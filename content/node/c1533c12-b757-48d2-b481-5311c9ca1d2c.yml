If you are aware of any or are planning any, please send them to us:\_<a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=4G62FrZLtKpw2pDTihLPd6j1FjKE8bC9\">stansfieldsmith100@gmail.com</a>.

But that can all be cured very simply: do away with the sanctions. Immediately do away with the sanctions, immediately do away with the economic war, and you will find out that most of these problems will disappear.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/cuba-embarks-100-year-plan-protect-itself-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Science Mag: Cuba Embarks on a 100-year Plan to Protect Itself from Climate Change.</a> “Cuba is an unusual country in that they actually respect their scientists, and their climate change policy is science driven.” — American marine scientist, David Guggenheim, president of Ocean Doctor. This article is an excellent example of the kind of things that a socialist planned economy can accomplish...potentially. It's also an example of the kind of things Cuba has been unable to accomplish (at least to the extent it wants to), thanks to the enduring U.S. blockade.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>More News</strong></p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article197536839.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump’s Axis of Evil: Cuba, Venezuela, Iran and North Korea</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Venezuela-Coup-Pinochet-Tillerson-20180201-0030.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tillerson Invokes Possibility of Pinochet-Style Coup in Venezuela</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/B8BVECc1758\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cuban 5 Hero Geraldo Hernandez Gives 26 min Interview with TeleSur TV</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/02/01/the-opposition-in-venezuela-terrorists-or-rebels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maria Paez Victor: Western Corporate Media paints Terrorists as \"Rebels\"</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://venezuelanalysis.com/News/13630\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Venezuela Unifies Tiered Exchange Rate</a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Allied Events</strong></p>\r\n<a href=\"https://afgj.org/honduran-democracy-activist-urgently-needs-solidarity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Act NOW to Demand the Immediate Liberty of Edwin Espinal Robelo!</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://afgj.org/partner-delegation-atc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">April Delegation to Nicaragua</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://afgj.org/travel-to-colombia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May Delegation to Colombia</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://icangotocuba.wordpress.com/sign-up-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May Day Delegation to Cuba</a>"
