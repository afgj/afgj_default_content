It now is on the President's desk and will go into effect when he signs it. The NICA Act attacks the Nicaraguan economy by mandating that the US vote against loans to Nicaragua by multilateral lending institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. Alliance for Global Justice considers the NICA Act to be part of the regime change strategy by the US government that accelerated with three months of violence from mid-April to mid-July of this year.\r\n<h1><strong>\"Nicaragua is a victim of double political standards\"</strong></h1>\r\n<strong>03 Nov 2018 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_<a href=\"https://default.salsalabs.org/Tecd01947-1345-480f-9559-4a4db0d89948/05f62edc-8cb3-4798-b272-539ff7fdf991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://default.salsalabs.org/Tecd01947-1345-480f-9559-4a4db0d89948/05f62edc-8cb3-4798-b272-539ff7fdf991&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1543522410023000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvIlSmYV-PPsrThD1E-ubnfK2NVA\">LA RÉDACTION</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<div><img id=\"m_-6703708125395304810id_79f05dfd-d532-42b4-ac36-6b6a732ca52e_img\" class=\"m_-6703708125395304810media-object CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/5LrJmrMK-ZQWsnOGTh5OzG7BrDlxwz5CvGyS4uxe9hq2RMp9V2Q1IcXbY-IFmbutg1PP0QyyFJedR4_o_fv62Bf8DC_kabDwBkuX3SNpPXh8xFfqNEbErRiOhOVPbTuDolXdeIxXqP97ZuYOJzcWiu8SuL_Jln7lBKeIjjwJ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://default.salsalabs.org/c6cceb67-c98e-4be6-bbdd-769c7c76327d/4554ff2b-54ba-44dd-b6d3-dbb0730da483.jpg\" width=\"599\" align=\"center\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"m_-6703708125395304810media-body m_-6703708125395304810media-body-center\">\r\n\r\n‘Like people everywhere, Nicaraguans want education, jobs, good transport and roads, a thriving economy, peace and stability.’ An interview by Alex Anfruns.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nJulie Lamin is a committed secondary school teacher in the UK and an author. During the summer holidays of 2017, as part of a teacher delegation organised by her trade union NEU (NUT Section), she travelled to Nicaragua at the invitation of the 'Nicaraguan teachers' union, ANDEN and the Ministry of Education. Their purpose was to support Nicaraguan teachers in developing the curriculum of English as a second language.\r\n\r\nExperiencing first-hand the 'huge progress' Nicaragua was making in the lives of young people and their families in terms of education, health and well-being in one of the safest countries in Latin America, Julie was shocked and hurt to hear of the violence that began to disrupt the country only nine months later.\r\n\r\nWhat was even more hurtful, knowing of the terrible suffering teacher friends were experiencing in Nicaragua at the hands of the self-named 'opposition', was the position Amnesty International took, as this is an organisation Julie supported with a regular monthly donation and participation in their campaigns.\r\n\r\n<strong>What made Julie change her view</strong>\r\n\r\nShe was 'shocked' Amnesty had a campaign to defend 'political' prisoners when she knew some of the people Amnesty was regarding as political prisoners were also the very people behind the violence her friends had endured. She immediately cancelled her direct debit to Amnesty and increased her monthly direct debit to the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign. She wrote to Amnesty International explaining why they had got it wrong with Nicaragua. Two months later her letter to Amnesty has not been answered.\r\n\r\nJulie described what she was seeing in reports from Nicaragua. 'Decent people's lives were disrupted by the 'tranques' road blocks set up by 'opposition' thugs in many cities in Nicaragua. These violent people, who tended to be young men, had ripped up the paving stones (Nicaragua has more paved roads than most Latin American countries) to build barricades preventing children from going to school, adults going to work and trucks from delivering supplies of food across the country.'\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Julie has a personal connection with Nicaragua : 'I put the context of what was happening into my neighbourhood. Had people been behaving like that in my street I would have called the police.'\r\n\r\n'That's where the double standards come in,' Julie commented. 'During the summer of 2011 when there were riots in cities across the UK, the police were on the streets with horses, tear gas, batons and shields. Afterwards, the court system handed down some very severe penalties, including a woman going to jail because she received a pair of stolen shorts and two young men being sent to prison for a message on Facebook that they had never acted upon.'\r\n\r\n'The police force in Nicaragua is different to the UK police and very different to the police in countries like the United States. I don't think the Nicaraguan police are trained to control riots like our police.\r\n\r\nNot only were the road blocks economically damaging, they were also an act of terrorism. You wouldn't argue with the thugs controlling them, especially as the weapons they had looked pretty powerful. Who supplied those weapons? They were an act of terrorism because they were used to attack the very individuals who were the symbols of what Nicaragua has achieved – teachers, neighbourhood workers, medical workers, police officers – the people who devote their lives to building a better country.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has a right to defend its peaceful, law-abiding citizens against those organising or participating in the terrorism and if they are in prison and awaiting trial, then that is Nicaragua's legitimate right. In my letter to Amnesty I stressed that these terrorist suspects were awaiting trial – they had not yet been brought to trial because, as happens in any country where there is a process of law, evidence needed to be gathered on both sides for the defence as well as the prosecution.'\r\n\r\n<strong>Could you tell me more about the solidarity between Nicaraguan teachers?\_</strong>\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have supported Nicaragua since 1979 when the Sandinistas ended the wicked dictatorship of Somoza and began to build a democratic country of mass participation. I was 21 then! I went to Nicaragua in 1987 during the Contra war as part of a reafforestation brigade; during the Somoza dictatorship the environment had been ruined and the Sandinista government was trying to restore its natural wealth.\r\n\r\nReturning thirty years later I saw a beautiful country capable of feeding its people.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineties I was so busy with my career and family I was unable to be active in solidarity work. When in 2017, my union asked for volunteers to take part in the teacher delegation I was delighted to be accepted.\r\n\r\nOur delegation worked closely with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education – we found it remarkable that the Ministry of Education listened to teachers and their trades unions – to take Nicaragua's education forward in the teaching of English (the Caribbean coast Nicaraguans speak English as a first language which is why Nicaragua wanted us to support their development of English).\r\n\r\nThe 2017 delegation was so successful, the NEU (NUT Section) recruited a second delegation for 2018. Sadly, due to the violence in Nicaragua and the advice of the UK Foreign Office, we were unable to go. I was devastated!\r\n\r\n<strong>What's your message to people in your country who don't know anything about Nicaragua?</strong>\r\n\r\nCountries like Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela simply want to have the same advantages people in my country want to enjoy. They want a free health system so that people can live healthier lives without fear that they cannot afford health care. Cuba and Nicaragua provide such systems and their people enjoy similar longevity and health to us. The children in the Nicaraguan classrooms all looked healthy and well-nourished. By contrast, there are many children in my area in the UK who do not look as healthy or well-nourished. Like people everywhere, Nicaraguans want education, jobs, good transport and roads, a thriving economy, peace and stability. That's exactly what the Sandinista government is trying to provide.\r\n\r\nYet the shadow over their desire for these basic rights is the one cast by the eagle wings of the United States, its flight path determined by the Monroe Doctrine of 200 years ago which declared Latin America as its rightful 'backyard'.\r\n\r\n<strong>The criticisms levelled by the UK media, including the BBC, accuse Daniel Ortega of being a dictator…</strong>\r\n\r\nThey fail to mention that he was elected with a 72% majority. They fail to see the demonstrations of mass support for him and for peace in the streets of Managua. They fail to mention how neighbours have defended their neighbours and neighbourhoods against terrorist acts with the tools to hand – machetes, spades, with sticks and stones – against well-armed criminal gangs.\r\n\r\nNicaraguans have risen up against the injustice of an attempted coup.\r\n\r\nIf the news media really want to know what a dictator does, they should speak to Nicaraguans who will tell them how the dictator Somoza dealt with those who opposed him: he tortured them, buried them alive in caves and threw them into pits and volcanoes.\r\n\r\nYes, there are many Nicaraguans who survived that dictatorship and that is why they defend the democracy they have fought for, a democracy family and friends once died for.\r\n\r\nSource : Investig'Action\r\n\r\n<h1>BRIEFS</h1>\r\n<em><strong>By Nan McCurdy</strong></em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Nicaragua among the 25 Best Countries for Retirement</strong>\r\nThebrainypenny.com information portal highlighted Nicaragua as one of the top 25 countries where retirees from other nations can enjoy their golden years. The list includes 13 Latin American countries, highlighting Nicaragua for its natural attractions. \"This beautiful Central American country has something for everyone…lakes, mountains, volcanoes and some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. The cost of living here is quite affordable, with the average rent for a 900-square-foot apartment costing around $460. You can live well with $1,200 a month and for $2K a month, you can live very well! A month of food is approximately $300, and a restaurant beer costs $1.25. Medical care is also reasonable, and many hospitals base their rates on age, not on income. There are beautiful islands to visit, snorkeling, diving, hiking trails, volcanoes to see, nature reserves and beautifully preserved architecture. You can also swim through the Nicaragua version of the Grand Canyon!\" (Channel 2, 11/27/18)\r\n\r\n<strong>More testimonies in Trial of Accused Murderer Medardo Mairena</strong>\r\nMedardo Mairena Sequeira, Pedro Joaquín Mena, Luis Orlando Pineda and Silvio Saúl Pineda Bonilla are accused as physical and intellectual authors of the attacks on Police in the municipality of Morrito, department of Río San Juan on July 12 that left four police officers and one school teacher dead, and 12 police officers kidnapped and tortured.
