The Embassy Protection Collective is prepared to stay at the embassy for the foreseeable future, for as long as it takes to protect the sovereignty of Venezuela from a coup led by the United States with its fraudulent puppet government that the entire world knows is a farce — unelected and illegal under Venezuelan and international law. We stand with the Venezuelan government and their legitimately-elected president, Nicolas Maduro.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The Embassy Protection Collective is in the embassy with the permission of the Venezuelan government. The Collective is not breaking the law but serving the people of Venezuela. If law enforcement enters the embassy without permission of the Maduro government, they will be breaking the law and invading Venezuela’s sovereign territory. This is a time when all who oppose US intervention need to show their support by doing all they can to protect the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, DC.</em>\r\n<div id=\"arena-live\" data-publisher=\"afgj.org\" data-event=\"1556138847198\" data-version=\"2\"></div>\r\n<script src=\"https://go.arena.im/public/js/arenalib.js?p=afgj.org&e=1556138847198\"></script>"
