We organized against US aid to the contras, helping match the lethal aid the Congress appropriated with humanitarian aid to provide education and healthcare. We took tens of thousands of US residents to Nicaragua to pick coffee and cotton, to build houses, schools and health centers. We brought Nicaraguans to the US to educate our neighbors.\r\n\r\n<b>Please support our ongoing solidarity work--\_</b><b><a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=4C8axJ8fHblVB%2BFUsHPQIcYFwBtVsx2B\" target=\"_blank\">your support</a></b><b>\_is essential.\_</b>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the US-engineered and paid for electoral defeat of 1990, <b>while many solidarity groups faded away, the Nicaragua Network continued to fight with our Nicaraguan friends</b> to defend the gains of the Sandinista Revolution. Since 2006, when voters returned the Sandinistas to power, the Nicaragua Network has been at work to explain to people in the US about the poverty reduction, economic development, renewable energy, and participatory democracy advances that have earned Nicaragua the praise of international organizations from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (for advances in food security) to the World Bank (for effective execution of projects). \_We see what a difference it can make for a small country to have a government with a “preferential option for the poor.”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Nicaragua Network is the oldest Latin America solidarity organization in the US</b>. It has been part of every anti-war movement since its founding in February 1979. In 1998 it founded the Alliance for Global Justice and then became its largest project. Veterans of Nicaragua solidarity are currently in leadership positions in every social and economic justice movement in the US.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today the Nicaragua Network publishes the only weekly English-language summary of the news from Nicaragua – the Nicaragua News Bulletin – which is the successor to the ancient telephone Hotline. We continue to take educational delegations to Nicaragua and have an Indigenous Rights Delegation planned for March 15-25, 2014, that will visit Bilwi/Puerto Cabezas and the Bosawas Reserve. Visit<a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=xF2v%2FG8wDeTxa6t%2BbDqxvMYFwBtVsx2B\" target=\"_blank\"> www.nicanet.org</a> for information!

Border militarization pushes them into the harshest terrains. And every year people die, usually from dehydration, dysentery and exposure, but all too often from Border Patrol bullets.<b>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nAt AfGJ we call border militarization what it really is: a human rights crisis caused by imperialism and capitalism. That’s why AFGJ’s Chuck Kaufman and volunteer Michelle recently put their bodies on the line in solidarity to stop Operation Streamline in Tucson, AZ. That’s why AFGJ joined up with the Overpass Light Brigade and the Backbone Campaign for an International Migrants Day protest of the NW Detention Center in Tacoma, WA. That's why we are developing the<a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=MjM3UFht4YpX7kTlsz2tDmYNxOj3mW2y\" target=\"_blank\"> Border Militarization Study Guide </a>—because people need to know about what's happening here and help us to stop it.\r\n\r\n<b>Your gift can help up carry on this work.

Many on the Revolutionary Left felt it was impossible to have dialogue with the Colombian government and its transnational corporate masters. The Liberal Left called for peace, but at the same time treated the government, paramilitaries and the insurgents as if they were all the same (despite 70- 80% of political violence being committed by the Armed Forces and death squad allies). Neither saw much hope for a real peace process. But today, the peace process is underway and, despite many problems, its prospects are good.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the beginning, we in AfGJ made advocacy for a peace process our top priority. <a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=GWxLyDk%2BcDDEl0dkR40uka%2FaDaETm2Sj\" target=\"_blank\"> Please make a tax-deductible contribution to AfGJ </a>to support our Colombia solidarity work; we are on the cutting edge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nc55Eboz_yXj4Sff_fmET2UtHbcsOg9PIUFA3iilsD1kE0TuuElvwsxEK0q8cPv0O_dWEckYRfuyl2nIAddzOLnYNGD4K5hhrjvzgea0YhE=s0-d-e1-ft#https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/paz-a-bordo.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"418\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“From our mountains surge the water and the energy that they deny us every day.” There can be no just peace without land reform and the protection of Colombia’s natural resources utilized for the good of the people above the profits of the wealthy and the transnational corporations. Photo by James Jordan.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AfGJ has always said that the ones who started this war and keep it going are the US and Colombian oligarchies, transnational corporations and their military and paramilitary servants. We do not endorse, support or communicate with insurgents or clandestine groups, but we do recognize that they arose as instruments of rural peoples in defense of their lands and communities.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As peacemakers, we have to look violence in its ugly face and ask: where does this come from? That's why we reject the US funded Plan Colombia and the US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. We reject the demonization of the insurgents, because that position only hurts prospects for peace. When AfGJ commits itself to peace, we want to know what are the practical steps to peace, and how can we support them?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\LPlease show your support for Peace in Colombia <a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=CjvG0wffEHTQb2vil3AkhHX90VHC0%2FRr\" target=\"_blank\">by making a contribution to AfGJ to day.</a>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/hFgIk5aD1hJtBwpcP5yiHW9M_gWIU58eF-kU1MyDi4P7w6_F-U8Kgcx9CBFQH2cOc_0ehW6krDOQusmT9XoaHjS9sj5LO5p1KogoZMnOqqNP=s0-d-e1-ft#https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/armar-o-amor.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"322\" align=\"right\" />And we are on the cutting edge in other ways. When no US labor body was acting in solidarity with Fensuagro, Colombia's largest agricultural workers union and one of the most persecuted unions in the world, AfGJ established a strong, close and ongoing relationship of solidarity. And we are still the one US organization that has an ongoing project of solidarity with Colombian political prisoners.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's no wonder then that, along with the National Lawyers Guild, we were the only two US organization represented at the launch of Marcha Patriótica, Colombia's largest Left mobilization for a just peace. And, by the way, the NLG's Colombia solidarity work was launched as the result of a joint delegation we did in 2011.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since we began our Colombia work, we have achieved some impressive results. We played a major role in helping US labor unions establish relations with Fensuagro; we have participated in successful campaigns for the liberation of key political prisoners; and we have been pivotal in turning the dominant theme of the US Colombia solidarity movement into one of practical support for peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>You can be assured that your<a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=48qV0XemWB9znghAI7MtYHX90VHC0%2FRr\" target=\"_blank\"> tax-deductible gift</a> in support of AfGJ's Colombia solidarity work is one way you can make a real and permanent contribution not just to us, but to that dream we all share of “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!”</h4>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">*</span>Tear Down the Walls National Gathering &amp; Nationally Coordinated Days of Local Action!</span></h2>\r\nThis past November Alliance for Global Justice invited activists from the US and beyond to strategize and network together at<b>\_Tear Down the Walls National Gathering</b>\_in Tucson, Arizona.

Meanwhile, carbon dioxide has built up in the air far beyond traditional safety levels and drought and “natural” catastrophes have become almost commonplace.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>At the Tear Down the Walls Conference in November, the Alliance for Global Justice made a proposal: let's organize a series of Ecological Truth Commissions throughout the country to hear testimonies from expert witnesses and affected communities.
