Over 20 political prisoners, including Edwin Espinal, have been arrested and are being held in US-style maximum security prisons without contact with their families and lawyers and facing life and health threatening conditions including lack of water, exposure to tuberculosis, and lack of medical care. </span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.anymeeting.com/PIID=ED54DA84874A3E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Join Honduras Solidarity Network Co-Coordinators Vicki Cervantes and Karen Spring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as other experts for this one hour webinar on the situation of the political prisoners in Honduras, how this is part of a global model of prison imperialism the United States is promoting, and what we as solidarity activists can do about it. There will be time for discussion and questions.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To participate </span><a href=\"http://www.anymeeting.com/PIID=ED54DA84874A3E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you must register and receive a unique link to log-in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
