By 1982 cocaine was the largest export from Colombia.The paramilitary army, Muerte A Secuestradores (MAS), was formed in Puerto Boyaca by the Medellin cartel, the Colombian Army, rich ranchers and the US based Texas Petroleum Company. It was decided that the resistance in any form in the country should be dealt with by extrajudicial means so as not to be traced. Political assassinations of popular leaders and disappearances increased greatly. Most of the cocaine came to the US and billions were laundered in US banks. The US cartels were who benefited the most from this business and certainly were interested in protecting their interests in Colombia.

After fumigation the land was useless and the people had to flee. But the production of cocaine grew because peasants had no choice but to plant it if they wanted to survive so they moved to other more isolated areas.The US not only was not concerned but secretly supported this production, making trillions on the sale in the US. The Colombians lived in terror.
