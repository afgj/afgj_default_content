AFGJ does not receive funding from any state, local or federal government the state of Arizona, or the counties or cities where its employees are located. Every dollar raised comes through earned revenue (fiscal sponsor fees, delegations), donations, bequests and special events.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Contributions from individual donors and foundations make up the overwhelming majority of support and our relationship with our contributors is the highest expression of our mutual commitment to the mission. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">AFGJ respects the privacy of its donors and has put in place a Donor Privacy Policy to honor these rights. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>DONOR INFORMATION</b></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">AFGJ collects and maintains the following types of donor information when it is voluntarily provided to us:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">• Contact information such as name, address, telephone number and e-mail address</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">• Giving information</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">• Information on events attended, publications received and special requests for program information</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">• Information provided by the donor in the form of comments and suggestions</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">This confidential information is kept on file for IRS purposes. It is also used to analyze overall giving patterns in order to make more accurate budget projections, as well as to understand donors’ interests in our mission and to update them on the organization’s plans and activities. This information is shared with staff, board members, volunteers and consultants only on a confidential and need-to-know basis.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b> </b></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>DISCONTINUING CONTACT UPON REQUEST</b></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is the policy of AFGJ to communicate with donors according to their expressed preferences whenever possible. AFGJ will discontinue or change the method used to contact any person upon that person’s oral or written request directed to the organization.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Upon a person’s (or a person’s authorized representative’s) request that AFGJ discontinue further contacts, the person’s name and address will be promptly modified in AFGJ’s donor database to ensure that no further contact is made with the person. AFGJ will also take steps to ensure that no further contact is made with the individual and that the person’s name is removed from any external databases or records under AFGJ’s control. However, AfGJ does from time to time solicit donations from donors to other groups whose lists we do not possess or control.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Permanent Record: AFGJ will maintain an electronic record of all requests for discontinuance of contacts, effective with the adoption of this policy by AFGJ. Oral requests will be noted in writing by the staff of AFGJ and then permanently recorded in the electronic donor database. The records of persons who have made such a request will be maintained by AFGJ to the extent necessary for legal or liability purposes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>OPT OUT:</b></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">It is the policy of AFGJ to allow donors to remove their name and contact information from any list we rent, trade, or share with other non-profit institutions which seek their support. We never rent, trade, or share donor information for commercial purposes. We recognize that many of our donors support other social justice and charitable organizations, however</span><span class=\"s2\">&nbsp;AFGJ will remove any person upon that person’s oral or written request directed to the organization from any lists we share, trade, or sell.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"LTR\" id=\":3q2\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img align=\"BOTTOM\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" name=\"graphics1\" src=\"http://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/images/cleardot.gif\" width=\"1\" /></span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>DONOR BILL OF RIGHTS</b></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">AFGJ subscribes to the Donor Bill of Rights, which was created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Non-Profits.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Donor Bill of Rights</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n"
