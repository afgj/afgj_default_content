H.R\_5708 will not be voted on by the Senate during the remaining days of the lame duck session, but could be reintroduced\_as a new bill in the House after the new Congress reconvenes in January. It is worth writing to your Congressperson\_and Senators now and again if the legislation is introduced as a new bill next year, telling them it will affect your vote if\_they co-sponsor or vote for legislation cutting aid to Nicaragua. You may even want to reference the 1986 World Court\_decision that the US owes Nicaragua billions in reparations which morally needs to be paid. Current US aid does not\_even cover the interest that accrues on the reparations debt. For those who inquired about my health issue, I am fine\_now and back to work. I just have to make some lifestyle changes and take some additional prescriptions. I plan to be\_around making trouble for US imperialism for a good long time yet! -- CK</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\_</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Who is Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What Does She Have Against Nicaragua?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On Sept. 21, 2016 The US House of Representatives passed without objection\_H.R.5708: The Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA) of 2016. This legislation\_states that it will be US policy “to oppose any loan or other fund use for the government\_of Nicaragua's benefit, other than for basic human needs or to promote democracy,\_unless the Department of State certifies that Nicaragua is taking effective steps to: (1)\_hold elections overseen by credible domestic and international electoral observers, (2)\_promote democracy and an independent judiciary system and electoral council, (3)\_strengthen the rule of law, and (4) respect the right to freedom of association and\_expression.” (<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/114/hr5708\" target=\"_blank\">https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/114/hr5708</a>) Given the\_amount of influence the US has with international monetary institutions, if this became\_law, Nicaragua would be denied accesses to the international credit that every state\_needs to function. The legislation is the baby of Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,\_Republican of Miami-Dade County in Florida. H.R.5708 is such terrible legislation it is\_hard to know where to start in talking about it. So, first, who is Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and\_what has she got against Nicaragua?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She is an extremely popular and extremely powerful congresswoman who has served\_Miami-Dade County since 1989. She was the first Latina and first Cuban-American\_elected to Congress. She was the first Republic woman elected from Florida. She has\_been reelected ten times never with less than 58% of the vote. Talk about job security!\_Certainly, Ros-Lehtinen is a conservative, and most of her positions are consistently\_right-wing, but there are some idiosyncratic aspects to her politics. She breaks from the\_Republican Party with her forceful, unapologetic support of gay rights, including marriage\_equality. She has a transgendered son and you have to give her credit for putting\_personal experience and the family above the party line.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Watching videos of Ros-Lehtinen, it is clear she is a bright, articulate woman. Whether\_speaking in English or Spanish, she presents what she has to say in a straight forward,\_organized, cogent manner. There is little of the bombastic, speechifying so common to\_Republicans on a roll. And yet, when she takes on an issue it is with a close minded,\_determination that admits no other point of view, no subtlety, and no compromise.\_Nowhere is this more true than in her crusade against the leftists governments of Latin\_America. Of course, the original fight was about Cuba. Her father has been an anti-Castro activist for years. However, history seems to be, at last, moving on from that long,\_drawn out, Cold War conflict. Now Ros-Lehtinen focuses on Venezuela and, most\_recently, Nicaragua.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is Ros-Lehtinen’s justification for The Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act\_(NICA) of 2016: “This bill is aimed at holding Ortega and his regime accountable for\_violating human rights and manipulating the electoral process for his own political gain.\_In addition, the NICA Act directs the Department of State to issue a report on how\_Nicaraguan regime officials in the Supreme Electoral Council, the National Assembly, or\_the judicial systems are directly involved in acts of public corruption and human rights\_violations. \_By passing this bill, the House has taken action to prevent Ortega from\_accessing international funds until reforms are implemented that promote democracy,\_strengthen the rule of law, respect human rights, and until Nicaragua holds free, fair and\_transparent elections overseen by electoral observers. We will continue to support the\_people of Nicaragua and assist civil society in democracy and governance programs but\_we must not allow Ortega to continue down this dangerous path without any serious\_repercussions.” (<a href=\"http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/ileana-ros-lehtinen-takes-aim-daniel-ortega\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/ileana-ros-lehtinen-takes-aim-daniel-ortega</a>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What’s wrong with that? Plenty. First of all, the underlying premise of the bill is that if the\_United States doesn’t like the way a country is handling its internal affairs, we have the\_right to step in and impose our desires on them. Nicaragua claims that H.R.5708 is a\_violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. They are right, but good\_luck getting either enforced. Second, the claims of corruption and human rights violations\_are exaggerated. Of course, Nicaragua is not perfect, but it is a country where lively and\_open political discourse takes place. Compare it to its neighbor to the north, Honduras,\_where the political opposition and press are regularly murdered with impunity and where\_the president has just declare he’ll run for another term even if the constitution says this\_can’t happen. If Ros-Lehtinen was really worried about democracy wouldn’t she have\_also proposed legislation about Honduras?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A third thing that is wrong with H.R.5708 is that it ignores the terrible history that the US\_has regarding Nicaragua's\_sovereignty. We have such dirty hands when it comes to this\_tiny, non-threatening country, that the only legitimate thing we can say is, “We wish you\_luck. If there is any way we can help, please feel free to ask. Oh yeah, and sorry about\_the ways we’ve acted in the past.” The final, and perhaps most ironic, thing that is wrong\_with this legislation falls under the glass house rule. Democracy is so flawed in the\_United States that it takes a hell of a nerve to tell some other country how to do it right.\_To offer just one example, Ros-Lehtinen’s party and the state she represents have acted\_to systematically disenfranchise the voters who are the most likely to vote for their\_opposition. If the congresswoman wants to work for a more democratic world the place\_to start would be with her own party, in her own state.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What to do? Ros-Lehtinen is a true believer. She is not going to change her mind on this.\_She is also not going to be voted out anytime soon. However, it would be very worthwhile\_to write your own representatives and express your dismay at H.R.5708. Ask your\_congressman how such a wrongheaded piece of legislation got through unopposed.\_There is a bill with the same name currently making its way through the senate. Let your\_senator know that you are against any law that inserts the United States into the internal\_affairs of Nicaragua.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\">References:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileana_Ros-Lehtinen\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\">Wikipedia: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/opinion/403505-quien-es-ileana-ros-lehtinen/\"><span class=\"s1\">El Diario: \"Quién es Ileana Ros-Lehitien?\"</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://archives.republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/news/story/?1819\"><span class=\"s1\">House Committee on Foreign Affairs: \"Ros-Lehtinen Opening Statement at Hearing on Peace Corps Volunteer Safety\"\_(re: Peace Corps)</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/09/23/nicaragua-loan-restriction-bill-congress\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\">TicoTimes: \"U.S. Congress looks to Condition Loans to Nicaragua on Political Changes\"</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/ileana-ros-lehtinen-takes-aim-daniel-ortega\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\">Sunshine State News: \"Ileana Ros-Lehtinen Takes Aim at Daniel Ortega\"</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/33122584/defying-term-limit-honduran-president-to-run-in-2017/#page1\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo News: \"Defying Term Limit, Honduran President to Run in 2017\"</a></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">\_</span><span class=\"s1\">BRIEFS</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">\_</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">The Nicaragua Ministry of Health will be allocated US$47.5 million in the 2017 national budget. A salary\_adjustment of 8% is contemplated for workers in this sector, as well as recruitment of 700 new employees. The Public\_Investment Program is US$57.5 million for the execution of a portfolio of 62 projects, including 19 new constructions.\_Among the projects are the construction and equipping of Family and Community Health Posts in Puerto Cabezas,\_San Carlos, Wiwilí, Siuna, El Viejo, and Chiquilistagua in Managua department.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 6)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Family remittances in the third quarter showed the largest percentage increase from Nicaraguans working in\_Spain while sending money home to their families.

He said Nicaragua is “one of the safest countries\_in the region and the world.”\_(El Nuevo Diario, Dec. 13)</li>\n</ul>"
