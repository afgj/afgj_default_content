Paraguay has the most unequal land\_distribution in the world and its agro-export model leaves little land to grow food for its own people, earning the\_country the label of “Soy Republic.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Learn with AfGJ about struggles by popular organizations for economic\_equality and food sovereignty.\_</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">We will meet with human rights defenders, trade unions, campesino associations, indigenous groups, student\_activists, political prisoners, women's collectives, torture survivors, and those who struggled against the Stroessner\_dictatorship, among many others. We will also visit former torture sites, such as the Museo de las Memorias, and\_the Archives of Terror, now part of UNESCO's “Memory of the World” register, which are the government records\_secretly kept by the dictatorship on the 50,000 people murdered, 30,000 people disappeared and 400,000 people\_imprisoned by the security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay during Operation\_Condor. The delegation will take participants to sites throughout the country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Approximate cost: $1,400. Price\_includes: hotels (double occupancy), food, in-country travel, translation, and program. It does not include\_international airfare or visa.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">For an Application, or More Information, Email: <a href=\"mailto:Delegations@afgj.org\">Delegations@afgj.org</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Extra:</strong> Two-day extension (additional US$200.00) to visit the famed Iguazú Falls, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\_This is a popular tourist attraction as it is where the borders of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil meet.</p>"
