Many of the doctors are Cuban, and they walk around the neighborhoods every day in their white coats and masks. The health personnel who go out every morning to tour the neighborhood from the CDI are accompanied by an individual belonging to one of the popular forms of organization that exist in the neighborhood, such as communal councils, communes, local supply and production committees.The house-to-house system has been successful in Venezuela.Its implementation has made it possible to launch an offensive against the coronavirus, conducting a search of every home to detect it early and avoid complications in patients, breaking the chains of transmission, and preventing its proliferation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cuba\r\n<a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/us-blockade-prevents-swiss-aid-to-cuba-20200423-0002.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/us-blockade-prevents-swiss-aid-to-cuba-20200423-0002.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587833291832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEk_nVxQQYgk_B-Rfdbudz9wYjMnQ\">TeleSur: U.S. Blockade Prevents Swiss Aid to Cuba</a> Swedish banks interrupted the transactions to Cuba due to the U.S. restrictive policies.

Cuba’s free and universal health care system puts the island in a better position to deal with this crisis than most countries.
