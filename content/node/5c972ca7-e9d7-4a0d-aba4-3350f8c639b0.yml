The prevailing coverage lays the blame for the conflict on Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and presents a politically narrow and historically shallow context. As a result, the message implicit and sometimes explicit in the coverage—that Ortega is the villain and his departure from office would end the conflict or solve the problems underlying the crisis—is distorted and misleading. This rhetoric, furthered by penalizing measures taken by the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress, targets Ortega, and by extension Nicaragua, as a brutal dictatorship and human rights disaster. Meanwhile, Washington applauds and offers moral and material support for the government of Nicaragua’s neighbor, Honduras, where there is indeed a brutal dictatorship and a human rights disaster. Unlike President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras, Ortega is not seen as a faithful ally of the U.S. and thus faces strong scrutiny and condemnation.\r\n\r\nThis hypocritical double standard highlights the fact that for a long time Ortega himself and Nicaragua, in company with Cuba and Venezuela, have represented a largely symbolic challenge to U.S. hegemony. The anger of U.S. administrations toward Nicaragua, Ortega, and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) goes back to the revolution that in 1979 succeeded in toppling the 43-year-long dictatorship of the Somoza family—Washington’s faithful and corrupt ally through successive Democratic and Republican administrations from Franklin Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter. The current crisis is not simply the story of a brave opposition and a brutal Ortega. It is a long-simmering conflict among different groups within Nicaragua that has been carefully manipulated over the years to put Nicaragua firmly and securely back under U.S. hegemony.\r\n\r\n<strong>Roots of the Crisis</strong>\r\n\r\nTwo incidents are commonly identified as the sparks that ignited the crisis: the government’s handling of a devastating forest fire in the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve and the government’s proposed social security reform. Students at several Nicaraguan universities were among the first and leading protesters to take to the streets to protest both these situations.\r\n\r\nThe Ortega government faced criticism for failing to respond effectively to the Indio Maíz fire and protect this important biological treasure, although\_<a href=\"https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/nicaragua-sends-more-troops-to-battle-wildfire/50000262-3581260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/nicaragua-sends-more-troops-to-battle-wildfire/50000262-3581260&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538683607094000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBdVLM4ZPjz6_JBlxf8bXaFm9zpA\">considerable resources were employed</a>, including army units, helicopters, and other personnel and equipment, to protect the reserve and fight the fire.

Diverging from his government’s successful consensus model for working with the private sector, Ortega had\_<a href=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/the-americas-blog/social-security-protests-in-nicaragua-hold-on-a-second\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cepr.net/blogs/the-americas-blog/social-security-protests-in-nicaragua-hold-on-a-second&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538683607094000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkp1caIyOeuTfk4D-FfkLEK7YJ7Q\">rejected a plan</a>\_favored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), COSEP (Superior Council of Private Enterprise), and other members of the Nicaraguan business community that would have entailed larger cuts in social security, including raising the retirement age. Ortega instead opted for milder reforms, which various parties rejected—from COSEP, the country’s most powerful business lobby, on the Right, to other sectors critical of austerity measures on the Left. Trying perhaps to appease both sides, Ortega canceled the reform, but the demonstrations had already pivoted to focus on government repression and calls for Ortega’s resignation after the first fatalities—two civilians and one police officer—were reported on April 19.\r\n\r\nThe media has\_<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/10-killed-unrest-intensifies-nicaragua-180422060137453.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/10-killed-unrest-intensifies-nicaragua-180422060137453.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538683607094000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvVM9Ba0DE6e-I0_a_XDjPKgbGPw\">portrayed</a>\_the first student-led demonstrations as spontaneous and indignant at the actions of the Ortega government. That may be true of many of the students, but there are also organized groups at the center of these protests that had been mentored and funded for years by agencies of the U.S. government. There is a trail of connections. The Civic Youth Movement (MCJ), which has already been active in Nicaragua for some years, describes itself as an organization dedicated to promoting projects of civic responsibility, education about and promotion of democratic institutions among students and youth. Whether this promotion of democracy is simply a broad and laudable principle or, in the context of Nicaragua, a specific coded critique of Ortega and the Sandinista government or even a call for regime change, is open to interpretation. MCJ was\_<a href=\"https://www.ndi.org/our-stories/youth-nicaragua-turn-organizing-skills-improvements-their-communities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ndi.org/our-stories/youth-nicaragua-turn-organizing-skills-improvements-their-communities&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538683607094000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsRWd7p0lEWjoxDA9z7tI6rX-r1g\">created and funded</a>\_by the National Democratic Institute (NDI).\r\n\r\nThe NDI itself is an arm of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), funded mostly by U.S. Congress, an organization that \_boasts a close history with the CIA. One of the first fields of operation for this activity was Nicaragua during the Contra War of the 1980s, when the NED gave several million dollars to anti-Sandinista opposition groups. More recently, the\_<a href=\"https://theglobalamericans.org/2018/05/laying-groundwork-change-closer-look-u-s-role-nicaraguas-social-unrest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theglobalamericans.org/2018/05/laying-groundwork-change-closer-look-u-s-role-nicaraguas-social-unrest/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538683607094000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFk7V-8UJDCvJACdjm7NbqYO8IWVg\">NED gave a reported $4.1 million</a>\_to opposition groups in Nicaragua between 2014 and 2017, ostensibly to promote pro-democracy activities. The history of U.S. interventionism in Latin America fuels skepticism about what kind of “democracy” NED is fomenting in the region after the CIA helped sow discord to unseat elected leaders in Guatemala in 1954, in Guyana in 1964, in Chile in 1973, in Jamaica in the late 1970s, and many more. With a history that rubbed elbows with the Iran-Contra affair in Nicaragua, NED’s activities among students and others in Nicaragua—and across the region—furthers cause for skepticism.\r\n\r\nOrtega’s government accuses foreign coup-mongers, including Washington neocons, of seeking to destabilize his government. Such suspicions are bolstered by the events surrounding meetings in June between opposition protesters and Washington powerbrokers.

The United States and right-wing Nicaraguans are certainly not the only influences on the country’s youth. The Sandinistas have a long and effective history of training and promoting youth mobilization and resistance. This was a crucial part of the resistance mounted against the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, and it continued during the country’s defense against the Contras in the 1980s. As a longtime Nicaraguan revolutionary reminded me recently, “We trained them to resist and defend their rights, and now they are doing it. Not all of this is solely the instigation of outsiders, though that element is certainly there.

He has not been found. \_In honor of his fifty-sixth birthday on October 1 his family, friends and colleagues organized an evening of song and prayer held at the Cinemateca Nacional. The evening was entitled “56 years of commitment, love and struggle for his country”. Among the participants were Nicaraguan artists and members of the Protestant community.\r\n\r\n\"We thank God because on a day like today 56 years ago, Bismarck was born. My husband has not yet appeared and, in spite of that, today we celebrated his birthday with the testimonial and revolutionary music that he liked so much.

He stated, \"Nicaragua has resisted the attempts of a coup d’état; our country has once again won peace, fraternal coexistence and the gradual return of normal daily life. The attempted coup that we have foiled in Nicaragua is the result of intervention and has left us with serious consequences, economic damage, death, destruction, terrorism. Terrorism disguised as peaceful protests, atrociously killing citizens and police, setting fire to public and private property, assaults, extortion, rapes, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In the [Central American] region Nicaragua is recognized for its stability, peace and regional security with important positive indicators in economic, political, and social development, in poverty reduction, gender equity and citizen security; and it is a barrier against organized international crime, gangs, terrorism, and drug-activity - \_state policies that we continue to develop.”\r\n\r\nMoncada said that the Nicaraguan government and people defend the principle of independence and sovereignty as established in the Charter of the United Nations and \"therefore we demand the cessation of any interventionist policy that violates international law with interventionist actions in Nicaragua and against other Peoples of our America and the world”. Moncada said that the government and people of Nicaragua have worked in a sustained manner to meet the objectives of the [United Nations] 2030 Agenda. \"Until the month of April of this year our country had experienced sustained economic growth of approximately 4.7% per year. Our projects and economic and social programs to eradicate general poverty at the national level managed to reduce it from 42.5% in 2009 to 24.9% in 2016. Extreme poverty decreased from 14.6% in 2009 to 6.9% in 2016,” he said.

They are accused of committing organized crime, kidnapping, torture, assault, injuries and illegal possession of firearms. “They kidnapped, tortured and seriously injured policeman Carlos Alberto Jiménez Campos, transferring him to the San José School, a center of studies used by the vandals to murder, torture and rape,” the police chief continued. The subjects will be referred to the competent authorities for their judicial process, while the police continue looking for others involved in the case.

They walk to secure the peace, to support reconciliation and to demand justice for victims of violence. This Saturday when President Daniel Ortega arrived to speak to the group it was raining cats and dogs. He went out in the crowd, in the rain, to greet people for a half an hour. \_(See excerpts from President Ortega’s speech below.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Nicaragua has Some of the Best Roads in the World</strong>\r\nAccording to the World Economic Forum on Infrastructure Nicaragua has among the best roads and ranks 54th out of 137 countries in a rating from the World Economic Forum on infrastructure in which the quality of streets, avenues and roads was evaluated. In Latin America, Nicaragua appears better than the Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Honduras; Uruguay; Argentina; Brazil; Guatemala; Peru; Colombia; Haiti; Venezuela; Paraguay; among others. Costa Rica appears with countries that have the worst roads in position 123. The study carried out by the World Economic Forum, is based on the opinion of 14,000 leaders and businesspeople who were surveyed on the quality of the roads of their countries, and according to these considerations, a score of one to seven was granted, in which the value 1 corresponds to roads with extremely poor conditions, and the value 7 for roads with extremely good conditions. Nicaragua obtained a rating of 4.3. The state of roads in a country can affect the economic and social growth according to Marianne Fay, chief economist of Sustainable Development at the World Bank.

Mansell, Executive President of ENATREL said that from September 20 to 26, they brought power to 377 homes in 6 communities in different municipalities.

That is to say, they continue in their process with an interventionist policy, disrespectful of International Law, disrespectful of the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague that condemned the United States for the acts of Terrorism against Nicaragua.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ And I say to the US Representatives, I tell the US Senators, that they are voting in favor of this interventionist law, that what is coming will simply harm the people and hurt the economy of the country, because with this law they want to hurt Nicaragua. They think that, with the law, the Nicaraguan people will fall to their knees, and they do not realize that this is a people that neither sells out nor surrenders!</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ But the Representatives, the Senators, should reflect a little: the US Representatives and Senators should understand how many times they have implemented interventionist policies, these sanctions against the Peoples of the world, not only against the Peoples of our America. Countless times. But that has not prevented the Peoples of Africa, Latin America and Asia from achieving independence to build their own way in the midst of these interventionist policies, in the midst of invasions, like those Nicaragua has suffered; like those suffered by the Dominican Republic, or the one suffered by Vietnam.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ They must understand that this is not the way, they must understand that with such actions they will never win the respect and affection of the Nicaragua people. The respect of the International Community will not be won with this type of action. At the end of the day they will not paralyze the Nicaraguan People in their productive capacities, in their work capabilities, in their creative capacities, because the Nicaraguan People are a hardworking People, and thanks to God, we have hard working men and women, we have fertile lands, we have creative forces to produce wealth in our country.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ I wish the countries that practice interventionism would understand this, because not only the United States, but other countries practice interference: it is the practice of those who feel powerful, and they forget the great defeats they had when they colonized the peoples of Africa and enslaved them. They forget how those Peoples rebelled and defeated the colonialists, expelled the colonialists from African lands. They believed that they were going to dominate them all the time because they were impoverished Peoples - precisely because of the colonialists who came to exploit them, to plunder them.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ We have a commitment to peace, and the commitment to peace goes through reconciliation, and we have to continue practicing reconciliation, which is the most effective dialogue to ensure peace in Nicaragua. We don’t want to repeat episodes of terror like those that our People have lived in previous months. We have to ensure peace by talking and talking in the community, in the neighborhood, and showing that we have a great moral strength. Thank God this is a People with great moral strength, with great dignity, with great pride, pride to be Nicaraguan, which gives us precisely the strength to do these Walks for Peace and for Justice.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ And they are Peaceful Walks! On these Walks no stone has been thrown against anyone. These walks of thousands and thousands of Nicaraguan families, can go by a place that belongs to someone who supports the coup and they will do no violence against those who oppose us. These are peaceful marches and the ones who have the strength to walk, to be part of peaceful marches, it’s because they are sure they are doing the right thing.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ No aggression comes from the march. That is part of our strength and what makes us powerful. Adults, youth, children, all walking together, under the sun, under the rain, on long journeys, as Gandhi did with his People, when Gandhi fought for the Independence of India they traveled for miles, and they did it in a peaceful way.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_ \_ \_ \_ That is why, sisters and brothers, Nicaraguan families, we must feel proud that there is a majority of Nicaraguans, an immense majority of Nicaraguans who are for Peace, who fight for Peace, and will defend Peace to the ultimate consequences.
