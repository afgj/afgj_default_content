The money comes from the ample funds the U.S. has illegally confiscated from the Citgo oil company. Many in the Opposition, particularly in the U.S., have already been coming down hard on Guaidó for abandoning the former Venezuelan military officers.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\">This case proves several fundamental points: That Guaidó is handling large sums of money; his constant attacks on the Venezuelan government are to limited effect; and he has not managed to break the unity of the Venezuelan military. It is also clear that he is financing semi-clandestine private activities, with nothing to show for it so far.

They were an assault group of about 60 men, with another 50 or so fifth-columnists already behind enemy lines, all hell bent on regime change. They were going up against the Venezuelan army’s 130,000 active duty soldiers and another 220,000 paramilitary loyalists. Eight “professional American mercenaries” had been killed and 23 captured, including two ex-Green Berets and a retired DEA agent. Steve Ellner noted that“Guaidó was at first on board with the plan but then grew wary of it, realizing it was doomed to failure.” “Obviously Goudreau was confident that once the military incursion showed signs of viability, the rebels could count on the solid backing of Washington and Bogotá.” “After having undertaken several abortive and embarrassing attempts to overthrow Maduro with the support of Washington in 2019, [Guaidó] is now more cautious, having learned from those frustrating experiences.\"</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\">AP reported that Goudreau—who allegedly first met opposition leader Guaidó through one of Trump’s bodyguards—had been running a series of paramilitary training camps in Colombia.</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\">\_</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https://default.salsalabs.org/Tb43284c8-f553-4446-8187-024a5ff1ef67/caea2cf2-6d93-430d-b32d-a79d6d49e5e6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://default.salsalabs.org/Tb43284c8-f553-4446-8187-024a5ff1ef67/caea2cf2-6d93-430d-b32d-a79d6d49e5e6&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589058097288000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcQFvsRjAmVQ9Uho9kMzQy3TEWDA\">OrinocoTribune: Pompeo, on the Failed Mercenary Incursion in Venezuela: “If We Had Been Involved it Would Have Gone Differently”</a> (I think it went the way it did because the US <i>was</i> involved) Pompeo said that they will use “all the tools” to repatriate the US citizens detained in Venezuela.

The only reason Goudreau produced the documents is that Guaidó stiffed him for the money, refusing to pay even a $1.5 million retainer fee. “They kept promising to pay, week after week,” he revealed in an interview with a Spanish-language TV station.

Police and military were granted special powers to ensure compliance. By April 11, almost 10,000 people had been arrested for violating lockdown restrictions.
