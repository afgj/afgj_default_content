      value: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R75iQK5sS9A\n\nEarly one morning, Maria—then nine months pregnant—and her family were stopped by the police for no discernable reason. A special breakfast outing became a nightmare—and at one of the most intimate moments of her life, Maria found a team of immigration agents—not her husband—by her side.\n\nMaria's chilling story is the centerpiece of \"Checkpoint Nation? Building Community Across Borders,\" a powerful new documentary that depicts the reality of post-9/11 racial profiling and its subsequent impact on women — as mandated by laws such as SB 1070 in Arizona, which are now being imitated and implemented nationwide."
