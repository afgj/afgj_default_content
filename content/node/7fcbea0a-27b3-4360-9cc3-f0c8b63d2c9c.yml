For the\_last 13 years he's lived and worked in Masaya, where he also looks after the link between\_Masaya and the UK city of Leicester.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nRaise four fingers (the sign for \"B\"), touch your nose with your thumb and dip your hand\_down to mimic an elephant's trunk. You’ve just said “Babar the elephant” in Nicaraguan\_Sign Language\_(Idioma de Signos Nicaragüense)\_for the deaf – and it’s a sign that’s\_distinct from that for simply “elephant”.\r\n\r\nIt’s not surprising that ISN (for its initials in Spanish) is a language rich in children’s words,\_since it was children that developed it. Until the 1970s, there were no facilities or learning\_programmes for deaf children in Nicaragua, but with the Sandinista revolution came a new\_impetus to provide education for kids with special needs. Some four hundred deaf children\_were identified in the capital, Managua, and two schools created for them. The initiative\_could easily have back-fired, as teachers were brought from Europe who tried to teach\_Spanish using fingerspelling, which the kids couldn’t grasp because they’d never learned\_Spanish at home. Instead, each had their own signs used within their families, and in the\_classroom, the playground and the school bus they began to share them, eventually\_turning impromptu communication into a common language.\r\n\r\n&gt;I learnt about ISN from Kath Owston, who is from St Thomas’ Hospital and is on a three-year career break working with deaf children in the Nicaraguan city of Estelí. A journalist\_there named Famnuel Ubeda runs\_an <a href=\"http://www.etavs.org/\">arts and media project</a>\_attended by around fifty\_young people who produce a TV magazine show and news broadcasts for the deaf. He\_also runs classes in ISN from his mother’s house. Neither project receives government\_help, and Ubeda is looking for sponsorship to be able to continue. Owston has been\_learning ISN at his class, which runs for three hours\_on Sunday\_mornings, attended by 14\_primary school teachers and a few parents. One is the mother of three-year old Shoskey,\_the child who showed Owston how to sign Babar the elephant. Brought up in a family with\_whom he could barely communicate, he now has hearing aids, bought by his parents with\_substantial help from an overseas donor. Shoskey loves using the aids, but his family feels\_he is making frustratingly slow progress in learning Spanish. It’s been Kath’s job to explain\_how much time it takes to learn a language, while offering Shoskey as much help as she\_can, given that Spanish is not her first language.\r\n\r\n&gt;ISN has grown from being the invention of a group of schoolchildren into an internationally\_recognised sign language. It might never have done so, as the teachers in the schools\_where it started weren’t able to understand it, much less appreciate how sophisticated it\_had become. So the Education Ministry turned for help to a US sign language expert, Judy\_Kegl, who in 1986 established that a structured language had indeed emerged, as the\_“pidgin” form that it took at the start among older students was eventually supplanted by\_grammar and verbs developed by the younger children. Steven Pinker, in\_The Language\_Instinct, said that ISN was like pantomime gestures being replaced by a language complex\_enough to be used in poetry, a life history, or to tell the plot of a surrealistic cartoon: “A\_language has been born before our eyes.”\r\n\r\nIt was a ten-year wait until the first ISN dictionary was published, helping the language to\_become more widespread, although lack of resources still prevents every deaf child from\_having their own copy. And it wasn’t until 2004 that interpreters were available, although in\_the last few years they’ve become more numerous and are seen on TV news channels\_and at official occasions, notably presidential speeches.\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Given the environment in which it has developed, it’s not surprising that ISN has specific\_signs not just for international comic characters like Babar, but for key political\_personalities. These embody some typically Nicaraguan humour. The sign for President\_Daniel Ortega, for example, is one hand tapping the opposing wrist (where he always\_wears his Rolex watch). The late Fidel Castro, often referred to in political speeches, is\_signed by a bossy wagging of the finger combined with a V-sign moving away from the\_mouth, as in smoking a cigar.</span></p>\r\nThe new sign for Donald Trump was first thought to be a gesture across the chest\_(indicating a presidential sash) followed by holding the nose. In the definitive version the\_second part has become smoothing the hair down across the forehead from right to left.\_More diplomatic, perhaps. And maybe it’s better not to risk stirring Trump’s interest in\_Central America.\r\n\r\nAnyone wishing to find out more about or contribute to the project in Esteli can contact\_Famnuel at <a href=\"mailto:Famnuel@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">Famnuel@gmail.com</a>\_or Kathy at\_<a href=\"mailto:owstonlewis@hotmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">owstonlewis@hotmail.com</a>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">BRIEFS</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li class=\"p2\">Vice President Rosario Murillo announced that more than 2,500 property titles will\_be delivered to Nicaragua families this month.
