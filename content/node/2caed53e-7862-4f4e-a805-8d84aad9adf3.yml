But also, it is anniversary of the re-defeat of the coup-mongers who tried to end the revolution. And they were not able to, nor will they be!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tomás [Borge] is with us. Tomás is in this plaza, crammed full of people, in those hearts, that are ready to defend their revolution.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Carlos Fonseca, Jr. is the son of the one of the Sandinista Front’s founders. His father helped launch the armed struggle against Somoza, and was killed by the dictator’s men in 1976.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>CARLOS FONSECA TERÁN:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_This [July 19] is the most important date in all of the history of Nicaragua, because it is the date when Nicaragua began to be free. Today we commemorate 40 years of the triumph of the revolution, which is also a historical landmark on a global level.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was one of the three fundamental historical facts that changed the history of Latin America: first was the Cuban Revolution; 20 years after, the Sandinista Revolution; and 20 years after, [Venezuela’s] Bolivarian Revolution.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each one of those marks an era: The Cuban Revolution kicked off the era of revolutionary armed struggle, the product of which was the Sandinista Revolution.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sandinista Revolution marked the era of the fall of the pro-imperialist military dictatorships in our continent, which allowed the Bolivarian Revolution to later usher in the era of the arrival of governments of various left-wing forces in Latin America, in various countries [the Pink Tide].</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we are talking about an extremely important historical event.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story of the struggle of Sandinismo is 92 years long, since the General Sandino fought against the US troops that invaded our country, and he expelled the US troops. Later General Sandino was assassinated. And then, decades later, the Sandinista National Liberation Front [FSLN] was formed. Roughly 30 years after.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is when the Sandinista Front initiated the revolutionary struggle, against the dictatorship of [Anastasio] Somoza, in the year 1961. It was an 18-year guerrilla struggle, which culminated with the triumph of the revolution.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then began the first stage of the revolution, in the ’80s,when imperialism imposed a war of aggression on us, in which we also were victorious.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then we lost the government, because of political blackmail done by imperialism, [with the US] threatening the people with more war if the Sandinista Front won the elections.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the neoliberal stage began, in which we defended the revolutionary principles of the front. And we undertook the popular struggle to defend the gains of the revolution.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we returned to government. And we are currently in the second stage of the Sandinista Revolution, under the leadership of Comandante Daniel Ortega, who is the historical relayer of Comandante Carlos Fonseca.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The Sandinista front is named for Augusto Sandino, the Nicaraguan revolutionary leader who led a guerrilla war on occupying US Marines between 1927 and 1933.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was assassinated by Somoza’s men one year after US troops withdrew.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>JULIO C. CASTILLO SANDINO</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: We are direct historical descendants of General Sandino. My mother is Blanca Segovia, the only daughter of General Sandino. She’s alive. She is 86-years-old.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has always been a great pride for us to be descendants of General Sandino, and the legacy that he has left us is not just for the families, but also for all the youth and the people of Nicaragua.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we are celebrating a victory: the 40th anniversary of the popular Sandinista Revolution.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>NICARAGUAN JOURNALIST</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Without any doubts, this is a historic date for the Nicaraguan people. This is the date when a dictatorship was overthrown, which for more than 45 years, kept all Nicaraguans struggling in poverty.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a historical date in which the revolution restored the rights of thousands and thousands of Nicaraguans that lived in extreme poverty.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, they have a dignified home, with free healthcare, with free education.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The 40th anniversary of the Sandinista Front was occasion to honor the historic combatants of the movement.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the living legends on hand was Edén Pastora, known as Comandante Cero.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cero led daring raids on Somoza’s forces during the 1970s, but flipped to the US-backed Contras during Nicaragua’s civil war.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He returned home to the Sandinista Front following President Daniel Ortega’s election in 2006.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>EDÉN PASTORA</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This anniversary is very important, with [the Christian religious symbolism] of 40: 40 years in the desert, Moses leading his people. 40 days, Christ in the desert.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we have 40 years fighting against imperialism, which has always attacked us, since [US colonial leader] William Walker came, since [the US government’s colonial] nota Knox, since they killed [national hero] Benjamín Zeledón.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since they invaded us three times, and used Somoza to kill Sandino, and carried out acts of barbarism.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have always had to fight. So today we are celebrating the victory of the revolutionary war, and the failure of what they did, the failure of this white coup.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: After the defeat of Somoza, thousands of US citizens flocked to Nicaragua to support the Sandinista Revolution, and to oppose their government’s dirty war. Nan McCurdy was among them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you were one of the Americans who came here in the 1980s to show solidarity — and you’re still here.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describe the mood in the ’80s and what brought you and so many others down here. And how is it different today?</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>NAN MCCURDY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Well what brought us was wanting to be part of a revolution that was changing society, eliminating poverty, giving land to people, creating justice.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anybody would want to be part of that. And more than 100,000 US citizens came here to live for one month to years.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we wanted to teach people in the States. So a big role was to help people from the States, get them to come down here and learn about the revolution, and learn about the US wars.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it was to help them see that the lies from the Reagan administration were just that: lies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And today it’s really the same thing. I mean it’s been the same thing all along. Nothing has ever really changed. I think we fool ourselves when we think, “Oh the US, they’re accepting the Sandinistas.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it’s never been true. They’ve wanted to get rid of them physically, not just their ideas, all along.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the coup was a wake-up call.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: After the celebration ended, we headed out to the streets of Managua to speak to grassroots Sandinistas, and hear why they are so committed to a government that has been relentlessly demonized in Western media.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA WOMAN</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: As a woman, I am very grateful for the government for giving us such a leadership role. This would not have been possible without the defeat of the Somoza dictatorship.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as a young person I am of course very grateful for all of the opportunities given to us by the government of Comandante Daniel and Comrade Rosario.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: And you, do you remember 1979? Do you remember the 1980s and the dirty war?</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>SANDINISTA MOTHER</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Yes. I was a kid during ’79. And we had a duty to support the guerrillas,here in the capital, supporting urban guerrillas.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we lived through the bloodshed of this dictatorship, and the massacre it carried out here, in 1979. At the end, with the desperation that it had, Somoza’s presidential guard forces bombarded all of the eastern neighborhoods, where I was. I even lost an uncle there, because rockets killed him.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there I saw a lot of people dying. I saw a lot of deaths there.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And thanks to the revolution, this was ended.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was ended. And the last year also confirmed that there, another bloody dictatorship like that is not going to come back, like what we had for 45 years in Nicaragua. It’s not going to return.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this, everything that we have seen today, strengthens and confirms that.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA MAN 1</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This government has given us young people, above all, the grace and right to education, for everyone. Also in the area of healthcare, as well as in the teaching sector.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA WOMAN 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This new stage in the revolution has taught us that we have a leader who cares about poor people. For this today, the youth, we weren’t living in 1979, but we are living in this phase, from 1979 to the present date, where we are provided free healthcare, free education, Plan Techo [a state housing program] for every single Nicaraguan family.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: And the participation of women is rising?</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA WOMAN 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Women’s participation, since 2007 [with the re-election of the FSLN] — in fact Nicaragua is one of the countries in Latin America that is on trend to, or is one of the top countries, where women’s participation has been growing well.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see women magistrates, women diplomats, women who play political roles. We have a woman vice president who has empowered women in all spaces, in all senses.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entrepreneurial women who are heads of their families, and they bring this creative economy, this family-orientated economy to every single home.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA WOMAN 3</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Now we have free education, not only in elementary school; we have free education in high school; we have free higher education in universities. We have many benefits.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who don’t study in Nicaragua, because they don’t want to, because they want to follow a professional path, they have technical education programs, the National Technological school, which offers a ton of technical paths.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we are here supporting this cause. We know that this is the only president who has cared about poor people, as my comrade said. And he has given this place to women, and above all to young people.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA WOMAN 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: We have seen that the government created a house for pregnant women; because we have the Berta Calderon Hospital, where women with cancer can be checked. We have, last week we created a solar power plant in Corn Island. So Nicaragua is progressing on the road toward prosperity.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Following the failure of the US-backed coup attempt last year,\_</span><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2018/12/14/congress-sanctions-nicaragua-nica-act/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress passed the Nica Act, with no opposition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It was a new round of unilateral sanctions on Nicaragua’s economy that complemented the Magnitsky Act, targeting the finances of the country’s leadership.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA MAN 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This is pressure. This is pressure to force our government to make changes, to do things that are good for them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are talking about imperialism. We already know what it’s about; that Yankee imperialism, unfortunately, is always interfering in countries like Nicaragua, in poor countries that try to make a political change.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, we are independent. We are dignified. We are a country that is definitely autonomous, and we should work as Nicaraguans to make sure that these things, these laws like Magnitsky Act, like other laws, don’t affect us. Because this affects the economy.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA WOMAN 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Nicaragua is a country that is full of entrepreneurial people, of people who like to work. So the Nica Act, we Nicaraguans are not interested in it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the government of national reconciliation and unity has raised the stakes for entrepreneurs,for small-business owners, for the producers that sacrifice day after day to make the food that we eat.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We export beans; we export rice, to the Yankees, to the imperialists. We Nicaraguans feed them.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In an apparent attempt to escape the crippling sanctions, the Nicaraguan government released scores of so-called “political prisoners” this June. Those released included many figures who had been directly involved in the violence during the coup.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was just one of many concessions the Nicaraguan government made during a peace and reconciliation process it launched with a recalcitrant opposition.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you all feel that, during the reconciliation, the prisoners who are tranquistas, who did violent things, they were released from prison?</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>YOUNG SANDINISTA MAN 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: That is a way for our government to show that it wants peace, that it wants peace and reconciliation, that it does not want situations like what took place in 2018.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, they keep acting in this wrong way, I think. But we Sandinistas, this country, we want peace, we want reconciliation. We want what’s best for our country.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>MAX BLUMENTHAL</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 40 years to the day that the Sandinista Front defeated a US-backed dictatorship, President Daniel Ortega stood before hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans in the plaza behind me, and promised to fight for peace and reconciliation with an opposition that is funded by the United States, which is extremely violence, and which is still dead-set on regime change.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the external pressure, this government has been forced to make massive concessions. And the question now is how much reconciliation is it willing to offer for the price of peace?</span>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Blumenthal is an award-winning journalist and the author of several books, including best-selling\_</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Republican-Gomorrah-Inside-Movement-Shattered/dp/1568584172\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Republican Gomorrah</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\_</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Goliath-Life-Loathing-Greater-Israel/dp/1568586345\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goliath</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\_</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/51-Day-War-Ruin-Resistance/dp/156858511X\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Fifty One Day War</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and\_</span><a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2868-the-management-of-savagery\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Management of Savagery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The Municipal Council will meet to discuss his replacement. Fargas was imprisoned for almost 11 months for being the intellectual and material author of the attack on the police station located in the Mulukuku community of Sislao Paraska, where three police officers were massacred in 2018. He was released June 11 under the amnesty law that President Daniel Ortega approved.

In his opinion, through the media \"hope and everything positive can be transmitted,\" as well as \"looking for good solutions\" among decision-makers.

Ambassador Bell, while advocating dialogue in Nicaragua, said clearly that the solution to national problems lies with the Nicaraguans. \"The international community can help, but we cannot solve Nicaragua's problems.
