At the same time Nicaragua is remembering the worst of the coup violence - deaths, torture, and terrible fear - that happened one year ago, especially on the anniversaries of some of the most terrible incidents such as the death by fire of six members of the Pavon family.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, we have new links to updated versions of our book on last year’s failed coup entitled, Live from Nicaragua: Uprising or Coup?

The crime of the Pavon family house fire followed the manual’s script with hundreds of thousands of messages on social networks blaming the government for the fire. The fake news might not have been so believable if people had asked themselves two simple questions:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who had control of the neighborhood, its internal streets and the four-lane road in front of the house?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was it possible for the Nicaraguan Police and its voluntary units to get to the house to burn it, as claimed by the opposition opinion-makers?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For any journalist with a minimum of experience and knowledge of the ABC’s of journalism, these two questions are not only logical but obligatory to ask in order to begin to understand the elements of the dramatic issue of the death of six people whose ages ranged from four months to 46 years of age.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We (Dick and Miriam Emanuelsson) arrived on January 28, 2019, in the Carlos Marx neighborhood. We explored some streets at the entrance to the neighborhood and the back of the burned-out three-story house. A group of about ten boys quickly moved away from us and further into the neighborhood. It seems that they didn't want to talk to us because we were coming with cameras and microphones. We also didn't want to risk following them, knowing that gangs were backers of “tranques” (roadblocks) last year and that they can be dangerous, both for one's physical integrity and for our work teams.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a car accessory business in the neighborhood of the burned house. We talked to a worker and a customer who gave us the answer to one of the questions, that of control of the neighborhood and its surroundings:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Here there was one\" (roadblock), said the owner and pointed towards the first entrance to the neighborhood, on the left side of the business, approximately 20 meters from the burned house.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- And there, [in the other direction of the four-lane road that passes in front of the burned house], another roadblock about 200 meters down?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"200 meters, yes.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- And there was no traffic here at the time of the fire?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"No, there was no traffic. Everything was closed down”.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Did the protesters have TOTAL control in this area then?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Everything, complete.\"</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- How is it possible, then, that they accuse the National Police of having set fire to the house?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I don't know. But we don't accuse anyone, it's dangerous for people. We don't think so.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- But here (at the entrance) there was a roadblock?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Yes, there,\" he said and pointed again. \"There was a burned-out fuel tanker. There were three more fuel tankers at the bottom (of the neighborhood).”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"No, there was no traffic. It was all closed,\" says a client of the business, neighbor of the Pavón family. \"There were a minimum of 30 roadblocks in the neighborhood.\"</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the testimony given by the survivor Janeth del Socorro Velásquez López, 29 years old, first on December 22 before the Nicaraguan Courts and the second time for the \"Juventud Presidente\" documentary filmmakers, she said the following:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"When they started, there were lines of traffic jams. In that neighborhood on that section [the four-lane road in front of the house] there were a minimum of 30 roadblocks. When someone passed by, they [those managing the roadblocks] chased them; `where are you from? ´. I had to tell them I was from the neighborhood. When a motorcycle passed by, they stopped it, attacked it and stole it. They stole everything, they burned the vehicles. There was a group of young people who were in charge of the neighborhood. A girl who is known as ´La Colocha´, because she was the one who investigated those trying to get through on motorcycles,\" said Janeth del Socorro to the \"Juventud Presidente\" documentary filmmakers \_in their documentary about the fire.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other relatives gave similar testimonies, confirming the threatening and thieving character of the leaders of the neighborhood gang. \_Even family member Daniel Pavón, who was not in the house that morning, said that ‘La Colocha’ threatened to burn down the house in front of him, his sister Maribel, and his mother.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sole three surviving family members denounced the roadblock delinquents for the fire and the loss of their family in the documentary.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>The death sentence to the family</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Facebook account of the self-proclaimed Movimiento 19 de Abril-M19A coup plotters, on June 14, 2018, at 4:37 pm, ten hours after the start of the national strike called by the opposition, they posted a threat against the Pavón family, declaring them practically a military objective:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Dear Sirs. Watch out for that old Oscar Manuel Velázquez Pavón [owner of the business, father and grandfather of the others who died]. These toads [term used for Sandinistas] sons of bitches opened their mattress house business today; they are infiltrated Orteguistas [term for those who support the president] who did not support the strike and they seem to think that they support the people. You know what to do to disappear all those who support the Sandinista shit.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty-eight hours later they would accomplish their goal in the early morning of June 16, 2018.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua Elected as Member of the Economic and Social Council of the UN by 184 Countries\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 14 Nicaragua was elected by the UN General Assembly to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), one of 10 countries representing Latin America and the Caribbean.

General Director William Grigsby Vado says that because it included thousands of simultaneous requests for service, they had to take down the page. Grigsby said, “Both attacks are related to people with the Superior Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP). And I'm telling you it's like receiving an award for the work we have done.” From June 14 to 17 there were new attacks on the website.

He was killed, burned and profaned on a public street by the US-backed opposition on June 16, 2018, in the Colonia 9 de Junio of Managua’s District 7. His sister said “He deserves this commemoration because he was part of the struggles for justice since he was a boy. Francisco’s mother, Amada Pineda, who was one of the women of El Cua (captured and raped by the Somaza National Guard for nine days in 1974), said that even though her son's murderers are free today due to the Amnesty granted by the Sandinista government in hopes of achieving peace and progress again, her commitment will always be to revolution. \"He's a hero of love and I'm very proud of him. Of course, his death hurts and hurts me very much. We want the country to return to what it was until last year; we are going to move forward,\" she said.

Near the US embassy nearly two hundred people were killed. Among the thousand participants were many youth and families. Alina López, one of the survivors, said, \"As parents we have the obligation to sow the seed of respect for our national sovereignty and national dignity. It is our obligation to tell our children all that our people suffered under the Somoza dictatorship and how we fought for freedom and give thanks to the thousands of Sandinista heroes and martyrs who put aside their personal aspirations and put love for our homeland above anything else.\" People were also killed leaving from Acahualinca, Santa Ana, Barrio Cuba and others. A commemoration of the massacre was held on Saturday near the National Assembly where the monument to the Heroes and Martyrs of Batahola is located. \_(Canal 4, 6/15/19) See photos: </span><a href=\"https://www.canal4.com.ni/index.php/multinoticias/49000-repliegue-al-vapor-2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.canal4.com.ni/index.php/multinoticias/49000-repliegue-al-vapor-2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; </span><a href=\"http://canal2tv.com/fatidico-junio-1979/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://canal2tv.com/fatidico-junio-1979/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; </span><a href=\"https://barricada.com.ni/heroes-martires-batahola/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://barricada.com.ni/heroes-martires-batahola/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Canal 2, 6/15/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua among Top Three Countries with Highest Vaccination Coverage\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicaragua ranks among the top three countries in the Americas with the highest vaccination coverage guaranteeing the right to health to the general population, said Dr. Celia Riera, PAHO/WHO representative in Managua on June 13. \_Riera praised the immunization program of the Ministry of Health (MINSA), which has a coverage of over 95 percent at the national and community levels reaching the most remote areas to serve the most vulnerable sectors.
