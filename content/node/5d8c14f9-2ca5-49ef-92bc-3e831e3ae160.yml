      value: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday of this publication week, the Empire succeeded in Bolivia, where it has failed in Nicaragua and Venezuela, to foment a coup against democratically-elected President Evo Morales. Morales resigned in an effort to avert further bloodshed and has been granted political asylum in Mexico. There are reports coming out of Bolivia of continued violence against indigenous communities and members of the MAS political party, but there are also reports that communities are beginning to resist the coup, expelling police and setting up their own self-defense units while demanding a return to constitutional government. This story is not over. Below is the statement issued on Sunday by the Nicaraguan Government in Spanish and English:\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua Condemns the Coup D’état Against </b><b>Bolivian President Evo Morales</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, on behalf of the Nicaraguan People, denounces and firmly condemns the coup d'etat that was consumed today November 10 in our Sister Nation the Plurinational Republic of Bolivia, imposing the resignation of the Constitutional President, Comrade Evo Morales Ayma, and Vice-President, Doctor Álvaro García Linera.\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We express our rejection and repudiation of the fascist practices that ignore the Constitution, Laws and Institutions that govern the Democratic Life of the Peoples. In Nicaragua, we have experienced in the flesh, these practices and crimes of hate, the violence that violates Human Rights, and imposes racism, terrorism, cruelty, humiliation, burgeoning and degrading treatment, as part of an uncivilized and destructive script that Empires use against Governments and Progressive Processes, in tandem with their Organizations and local hitmen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bolivian People, Families, Women, Young People, have known 13 years of Stability, Peace, Good Government and Decisive Advancement against Poverty.

Those contradictions are essential to ensure the various imperial needs of the Western ruling elites, especially submission to their phony moral authority, are met. Claiming to promote justice, freedom and prosperity, they and their political servants inflict savage injustice and brutal repression, systematically immiserate their victims and loot their wealth. They forcibly legitimize their imperialism by means of an omnipresent but unacknowledged Inquisition, entrenched in structures of national and international governance.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who effectively report this reality are rare exceptions. In practice, all faithful reporting on imperialist military or economic aggression ends up expressing solidarity with that aggression’s victims. People producing such genuine reports who refuse to assimilate are shoved to the margins and excluded and if they successfully overcome that exclusion they are ruthlessly repressed. The imperialist Inquisition authorities stigmatize successful exponents of genuine reporting as accursed individuals they can legitimately persecute torture or kill. The notorious continuing</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/world/europe/julian-assange-torture-un.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_torture of Julian Assange</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_or the recent\_</span><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/472083-max-blumenthal-arrested-venezuela-embassy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intimidation of Max Blumenthal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_recall the\_</span><a href=\"https://www.consortiumnews.com/2004/121304.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ordeal of Gary Webb</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_who exposed US government involvement in narcotics related to the Iran-Contra scandal.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The relatively high profile cases of Assange and Blumenthal serve to emphasize the daily routine savagery endured by the innumerable nameless victims of imperialism and what that barbarism means in terms of domestic politics. In a\_</span><a href=\"https://www.grupotortuga.com/Gobierno-y-judicatura-espanola\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent example from Europe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Spanish authorities’ declined to prosecute police officers who fired plastic bullets at African migrants trying to swim ashore to Spanish territory, causing 15 of the migrants to drown. The incident confirms that migrants to Europe or North America are regarded as just so many accursed individuals whose lives are effectively forfeit. In relation to that crime,\_</span><a href=\"http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/7917\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agustín Velloso recently pointed out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “Fascism changed its name under democracy and lives on as neofascism… the difference between fascism and neofascism is resignation to it, its acceptance or even its celebration among the population, depending on their political opinion.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This reality clearly applies to both the European Union countries and to the US and Canada. Nor is it by accident that right wing Latin American politicians have facilitated the sadistic persecution of Julian Assange and the thuggish harassment of Max Blumenthal. The Western imperialist elites and their local allies face widespread mass resistance in Latin America, challenging precisely the kind of neofascist policies, marrying corporate and political power, now regarded as normal in North America and Europe. Penitent Inquisition collaborator, center-right Ecuadoran President Lenin Moreno, betrayed Julian Assange to the British authorities currently torturing Assange to death. Venezuela’s neofascist opposition facilitated the Inquisition’s attack on free speech targeting Max Blumenthal. \_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blumenthal and\_</span><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/09/30/golpe-venezuela-ricardo-hausmann-renunciar-grayzone/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his Gray Zone colleagues</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_have successfully exposed Venezuela’s political opposition as\_</span><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/10/24/usaid-funds-salaries-of-venezuelan-coup-leaders-to-lobby-us-politicians-for-regime-change/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">larcenous paid stooges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_of the US government. Like Blumenthal, solidarity activists Ben Rubinstein, Margaret Flowers, David Paul, Adrienne Pine and Kevin Zeese are all targeted by lawfare abuse of the US legal system for their role in defending the integrity of Venezuela’s embassy in Washington earlier this year. Zeese and Flowers produce the highly regarded\_</span><a href=\"https://popularresistance.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular Resistance web site</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_and\_</span><a href=\"https://clearingthefog.podbean.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">related media</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, consistently challenging the crimes of US and allied imperialism around the world. But apart from their challenge to imperialism, Assange, Blumenthal and the others are also targets of the imperialist Inquisition because they expose the falsity of the Inquisition’s news media and NGOs</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Western NGOs or news media in no way at all set out to report foreign affairs truthfully. That is not their role. Rather their role is to serve as the Inquisition’s clerks. They set down and lay out the charges against the recalcitrant accused. They justify the exonerations, pardons and waivers for penitents, collaborators and supergrass witnesses. With a straight face, they duly present the scandalously unfair bogus evidence against the accused which transmogrifies almost\_ instantly into the imperialist Inquisition’s sentence. Finally, they report the punishments, generally extolling the Inquisition’s just, beneficent intentions with occasional admonitions about some occasional excess of genocidal zealotry or the need to tweak some minor injustice within the overall horror.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writers like Assange and Blumenthal have exposed this sinister media theater for what it is, namely a neofascist system fusing political and corporate power to impose anti-democratic disinformation and downright lies. They and other writers, like Vanessa Beeley and Eva Bartlett on Syria, have demonstrated the mendacity of reports by, for example, the Organization of American States or by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights or the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and by related, self-serving NGOs. They have shown how the US and its allies induce compromised, dishonest reports from those organizations so as to affirm the judgments, sentences and punishments prescribed by their imperialist Inquisition.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear examples of this reality have been the Inquisition’s treatment of October’s uprisings in the streets of Chile and Ecuador against neoliberal austerity and the electoral defeat of the Western elites’ local allies in Bolivia and Argentina. These categorical setbacks for Western imperialism throw into relief and to some extent explain the desperation of the failed right wing coup attempts by US proxies in\_</span><a href=\"http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/6122\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicaragua in 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_and in Venezuela earlier this year. In both Nicaragua and Venezuela, US payrolled right-wing stooges tried to seize power seeking to impose the very same neoliberal policies that have provoked widespread protests recently against US allied governments throughout Latin America.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Inquisition’s institutions and media played down, attacked or deprecated the genuine popular uprisings in Ecuador and Chile and their electoral equivalents in Bolivia and Argentina. By contrast, they openly supported and encouraged the failed right-wing coup attempts in Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The KolFACI Initiative has increased productivity in the agricultural sectors of the region, contributing to the efforts of member countries to guarantee food security and eradicate poverty. South Korean Ambassador to Guatemala, Seok-Hwa Hong said, “Nicaragua is an example in the region for successful execution of productive development projects. In the last twelve years, national agricultural production has increased by 86% and livestock production grew 65%, contributing to the fight against poverty and strengthening food security in the country.” OPANAL promotes education for disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Americas.

This positive economic outlook is due to the macroeconomic policy implemented in the country stabilizing liquidity conditions. Standard and Poor Global Ratings highlighted the recent measure implemented by the Nicaragua Central Bank that reduced the currency devaluation from 5% to 3%, thereby improving the purchasing power of Nicaraguans. President of the BCN, Ovidio Reyes explained that “the financial system reflected a prudent stance resulting in an increase in liquidity in both domestic and foreign currency.

Fonseca is widely loved and respected as the father of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation. President Ortega and Doris Tijerino spoke to a large crowd in Managua. Tijerino was a close friend of Fonseca, co-combatant against the Somoza dictatorship and first head of the Sandinista Police. In Ocotal, Dayán Zeledón said that “as Sandinistas we commemorate with commitment the immortality of a great human being, an example for all Nicaraguans, who gave his life to guarantee peace, education, health, and the healthy recreation that the children of today have.

The General Assembly voted 187-3 with two abstentions to condemn the US blockade. The Nicaraguan representative to the UN, Jaime Hermida, noted that the US blockade has caused losses to Cuba in the order of US$4.3 billion, directly affecting sensitive sectors, such as health, education, sports, among others. He declared “such unilateral restrictive measures have a serious impact on the human rights of peoples as a whole. We are convinced that no state has the right to dictate its will to others through unilateral coercive economic measures that violate international law and the Charter of the United Nations. This practice is illegitimate, illegal and devalues the advances made in global economic governance.” Brazil this year joined Israel and the US in support of the Cuba blockade. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the countries of the African continent and others reiterated their solidarity with Cuba and called for an immediate end to this blockade.

Media such as The Washington Post, Associated Press and others, highlighted the decision of Betancourt, first judge of the Managua Criminal District Specialized in Violence. After the end of the trial the victim's parents and U.S. District Attorney Steve Cornwell declared themselves satisfied with the way justice was done in Nicaragua. Prosecutor Cornwell, district attorney for Broome County, New York, said, “We wanted to prosecute him in the US, but [after he fled to Nicaragua] we saw justice done in a court on an international stage.” The trial was videoconferenced, which Nicaragua has been able to do for the past three years as part of the introduction of modern technologies to the administration of justice. Other similar trials have been conducted with countries such as England and Costa Rica. (Radio Ya, 11/7/19)</span>"
