Although the legal standards for avoiding conflict of interest for nonprofit organizations are fairly limited, AfGJ will avoid where possible the appearance of impropriety.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Palatino Linotype,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If an issue is to be decided by the Board or Board/Staff Collective that involves potential conflict of interest for a Board Member or Staff, it is the responsibility of the Board Member or Staff to:</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Palatino Linotype,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">1.

Generally, Board Members and Staff will not receive pass-through dollars for individual projects.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Palatino Linotype,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If there is a family relationship between a Board Member and Staff, or among Board Members or Staff, it is the responsibility of the Board Member(s) and/or Staff to:</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Palatino Linotype,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">1.
