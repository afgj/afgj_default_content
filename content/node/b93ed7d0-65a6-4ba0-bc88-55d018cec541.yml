      value: "<b>By Nora Mitchell and Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 20, 2020, Vox.com published a piece entitled <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/20/21131451/nicaragua-la-prensa-press-freedom\">“Burnt radio stations and 18-month newsprint blockades: Inside the slow culling of Nicaragua’s free press”</a> that has multiple problems. The first of the many problems with this propaganda piece is that one of its authors – <a href=\"https://www.thecanary.co/exclusive/2018/10/04/longtime-friend-of-deported-guardian-reporter-speaks-out-on-their-work-inhabiting-the-role-of-a-foreign-agent-of-imperialism-2/\">Carl David Goette Luciak</a> - who initially came to Nicaragua to support anti-canal activists, was a close friend of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=photos+carl+david+goette+luciak&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03P9No3Gh6ErSXWq0WflvU-ooxc5g:1582318685328&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=FtkGtwvhPuUkaM%253A%252CGXrwSNmiBjU3pM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kSBt3cdoWfZHqJA37w4RTDlxqmFNQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved\">leaders of the violent opposition</a> who were funded and directed by the US to attempt regime change. Goette Luciak can be seen in multiple photos with the opposition and with their armed lackeys; one of the photos was used for the cover of the book about the attempted coup, <a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes-live-from-nicaragua-uprising-or-coup\">Nicaragua 2018: Uprising or Coup?</a> He is also captured on video taking photos of an old man being tortured by the opposition in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXzmLaVMU-A&amp;t=3s\">documentary March of the Flowers</a>. He appears at second 13 in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU2rNqFkjw\">video</a> from the Flowers March which took place in Managua on June 30, 2018.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12539\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-12539\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image2-300x184.png\" alt=\"Carl David Goette Luciak with armed opposition\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /> Carl David Goette Luciak with armed opposition[/caption]\r\n\r\nWe had seen the photos of Geotte Luciak with the armed opposition, but became very concerned and began <a href=\"https://popularresistance.org/why-didnt-carl-david-goette-luciak-say-something-about-the-torture-he-witnessed/\">to write</a> about him when he did nothing after witnessing the torture of the man during the Flowers March. When he began his journalist career, without credentials, <a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/how-an-american-anthropologist-tied-to-us-regime-change-proxies-became-the-msms-man-in-nicaragua/249868/\">writing for the Washington Post and the Guardian in 2018,</a> he never mentioned that the opposition was armed and violent. And after he witnessed the <i>Flowers March</i> he still did not report on the opposition brutality and their campaign of terror against Sandinistas and government workers. More than a year later and he still has not reported on it.\r\n\r\nThe authors began the VOX article by hinting at government limits on the internet, ridiculous given healthy commercial internet enterprises as well as the government audacity at providing free internet in parks for the population, even in the most isolated parts of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the second and twenty-second paragraphs, the authors claim that government supporters burned down radio stations, for which there is not a shred of evidence. The Nicaraguan <a href=\"https://www.lavozdelsandinismo.com/nicaragua/2018-10-03/identifican-en-juicio-a-autores-del-incendio-de-tu-nueva-radio-ya/\">opposition burned down</a> the most popular radio station, the private pro-Sandinista <i>Tu Nueva Radio Ya</i>, located in front of the Central American University, one of the seats, then and now, of the opposition. They actually attempted to burn it down twice, succeeding the third time with twenty employees who barely made it out alive. They also burned down <a href=\"http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/general/244633/queman-los-restos-del-edificio-de-radio-nicaragua/\">Radio Nicaragua</a> and the National Autonomous <a href=\"https://www.telesurtv.net/news/grupos-violentos-queman-centro-universitario-nicaragua-20180421-0002.html\">University Student Center and Radio Station</a> in Leon killing Sandinista student, <a href=\"http://canal2tv.com/autoridades-rinden-homenaje-a-cristhian-emilio-cadena-en-leon/\">Christian Cardenas</a>.\r\n\r\nThen the authors claim that the government restricted free press by blocking newsprint and ink to the newspaper, <i>La Prensa</i>. Few people read newspapers in Nicaragua and slowly print versions have gone by the wayside. <i>La Prensa</i> fired two hundred employees in mid-2018. More than one in five US papers has closed but nobody blames the US government. It's a tough market for print newspapers all over the world!\r\n\r\n<i>La Prensa</i> is owned by the Chamorro family, members of which own <i>La Prensa, Confidencial</i> and direct the nongovernmental organizations <i>CINCO, Invermedia</i> and <i>La Fundacion Violeta Barrios</i> which channel USAID and NED money to other organizations and media. They <a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes-carlos-fernando-chamorro-and-confidencial\">create constant fake news</a> that helped launch and support the attempted coup and they promote US sanctions and intervention. The Chamorro family are known historically for having a monopoly on the US-financed media.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12540\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"225\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-12540\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image1-225x300.png\" alt=\"La Prensa owner Jaime Chamorro with his Trump Shirt\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /> La Prensa owner Jaime Chamorro with his Trump Shirt[/caption]\r\n\r\n<i>La Prensa</i> had long overdue debts with the customs office (Direcion General de Aduana, DGA) which the newspaper refused to pay and instead accused the government of blocking their paper and ink supply and requested help from the US press.\r\n<i>\r\n</i><i>La Prensa</i> also has a long record of abusing the tax exemptions for newspaper printing materials by using the supplies for other print businesses and also importing luxury cars and even yachts. The exemption was only for legitimate work vehicles.\r\n\r\nBut the onslaught of international media articles certainly did convince the government to release <i>La Prensa’s</i> materials even though the paper owes money to the customs office.\r\n\r\nThe international press over recent years <a href=\"https://twoworlds.me/latin-america/the-slow-death-of-investigative-journalism/\">prints and reprints lies</a> that coincide with the opposition narrative. It’s like the saying about how a lie that is repeated again and again becomes the truth, at least in the US. The Nicaraguan population is savvy and does not easily buy the story of repression against <i>La Prensa</i> because they have seen the US use this paper for over fifty years against the population, most notably during the US-contra war.\r\n\r\nSince 2018 Journalists go to Nicaragua only briefly, seem to have their story already written and only interview the opposition. Nicaraguans love to talk about politics and if journalists would really do a bit of investigation and talk to all sides the articles might not be pure propaganda for the US-backed opposition.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that La Prensa <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Prensa_(Managua)\">has received funds</a> from the US government since the 1980s, and most openly through the <a href=\"https://theglobalamericans.org/2018/05/laying-groundwork-insurrection-closer-look-u-s-role-nicaraguas-social-unrest/\">National Endowment for Democracy</a>.\r\n\r\n<i>La Prensa, Confidencial, Radio Corporacion, Onda Local, Canal 10, 100% News</i> and all the opposition press live an unimaginable press freedom in Nicaragua constantly lying about the government, and during the attempted coup, calling for regime change and the assassination of the constitutional president and his family. If this happened in the US the media owners would go to prison for suggesting such an atrocious crime.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua only Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda of <i>100% Noticias</i> went to prison. <a href=\"https://www.nicaraguainvestiga.com/quienes-son-los-verdugos-del-director-de-100-noticias-miguel-mora/\">Miguel Mora</a> threatened a young policeman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaV7LOEIpn0&amp;t=10s\">Gabriel de Jesus Vado Ruiz</a>, who soon after was kidnapped, tortured, killed and burned in Masaya. Mora also threatened a municipal worker, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jICLuyGvaYc&amp;t=2s\">Bismark Martinez</a> who soon after was disappeared and found dead a year later. Bismark’s torturers uploaded videos to Facebook. Pineda is on video with those who burned down Granada government buildings with the fires raging behind them.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12541\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-12541\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image3-300x200.png\" alt=\"Lucia Pineda and Miguel Mora met with US Vice President Mike Pence where he assured them he “would not leave the Nicaraguan people alone.” Photo: The White House\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> Lucia Pineda and Miguel Mora met with US Vice President Mike Pence where he assured them he “would not leave the Nicaraguan people alone.” Photo: The White House[/caption]\r\n\r\nThanks to the Sandinista government’s desire for peace and reconciliation, Mora and Pineda received amnesty in June 2019.\r\n\r\nKnowing what Goette-Luciak did in Nicaragua, for which he was deported on October 1, 2018, and with numerous <a href=\"https://azvsas.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-curious-case-of-carl-david-goette.html\">articles</a> and photos attesting to his behavior, it is more than a little surprising that a media outlet like VOX would print an article by him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Acrobat Nik Wallenda walks tightrope above Masaya Volcano\r\n</b>In a record time of 30 minutes, the American acrobat Nik Wallenda, managed to cross the crater of the Masaya volcano, 550 meters, walking on a rope on March 4, setting a new world record. Wallenda thanked Nicaragua for the support he received and said it was the most important feat of his life. \"Very special, I was prepared, but the winds were unpredictable, it was something like taking my feet off the ground, but that's what I do and you get used to it, the gusts there are very strong,” said the acrobat. Wallenda said there was a moment when his glasses were completely covered by the smoke coming out of the Masaya volcano, which caused him to disappear for a while. \"It was tremendous, just seeing the lava is tremendous,\" he said. The Masaya volcano, located 23 kilometers southeast of Managua, is one of Nicaragua's main tourist attractions, especially because tourists can reach the edge of its crater in any car.\_ See photos here: <a href=\"http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/general/280075/nick-wallenda-logra-cruzar-crater-del-volcan-masaya/\">http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/general/280075/nick-wallenda-logra-cruzar-crater-del-volcan-masaya/</a>\_ (Radiolaprimerisima, 3/4/20)\r\n\r\n<b>Record Number of TV Viewers Watch Wallenda\r\n</b>Nicaraguan Channel 6 obtained a record of close to 4 million viewers during the transmission of the mega event \"Volcano Live,\" transmitting the tightrope feat above the Masaya Volcano of the acrobat Nik Wallenda, as well as showing environmental and scientific characteristics of the volcano. (El19Digital, 3/5/20)\r\n\r\n<b>No Votes against Nicaragua in the OAS\r\n</b>The Nicaraguan opposition has just suffered another defeat with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, telling Andrés Oppenheimer on CNN on Feb. 28th that there is no statement from the OAS saying that the government of Nicaragua is not legitimate. In November of last year, in declarations to CNN, Almagro had said that the objective of the OAS was not to expel, nor suspend Nicaragua from the inter-American organization, and that the US could never get the votes to invoke the Democratic Charter. Almagro said the objective should be the elections for 2021. \"The rest should serve as an instrument, but it is not the fundamental objective (to get Nicaragua out of the OAS).” This totally contradicts the continued discourse of the Nicaraguan opposition.
