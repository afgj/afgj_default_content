      value: "<strong>This week’s NicaNotes blog addresses the issue of the deportation from Nicaragua of freelance journalist Carl David Goette Luciak with two pieces. The first is an essay by Nan McCurdy addressing the claim to the mantle of a journalist’s freedom of the press. The second is a letter-to-the-editors of The Guardian, Washington Post, and other media that used Goette Luciak’s “reporting.” The author of the second piece is a long-time friend who traveled with Goette Luciak to Nicaragua to, as he states, “use our friendships with Nicaraguan opposition figures to push for the end of the Sandinista government and create careers for ourselves…”</strong>\r\n<h1><strong>WHY DIDN’T CARL DAVID GOETTE-LUCIAK SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE TORTURE HE WITNESSED?</strong></h1>\r\n<strong>By Nan McCurdy, Popular Resistance\_<a href=\"https://popularresistance.org/why-didnt-carl-david-goette-luciak-say-something-about-the-torture-he-witnessed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://popularresistance.org/why-didnt-carl-david-goette-luciak-say-something-about-the-torture-he-witnessed/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539286568768000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJxueNOlF8bxpxHTWBI8AIaGVyrg\">https://popularresistance.org/<wbr />why-didnt-carl-david-goette-<wbr />luciak-say-something-about-<wbr />the-torture-he-witnessed/</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>October 8, 2018\_</strong>\r\n\r\nNote:\_ There has been a great deal of inaccurate and biased reporting about Nicaragua written in support of regime change and presenting a false narrative of what occurred in the Nicaraguan uprising.

Goette-Luciak, from Blacksburg, Virginia (the bible belt of rural Virginia) was suspected by people as working for the CIA (which his family denies) because his reporting always supported the attempted violent coup.\r\n\r\nGoette-Luciak was lucky he was deported and not prosecuted criminally in Nicaragua as he arguably aided and abetted torture and bloodshed by not reporting on the perpetrators.

Photo | Facebook\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nLuciak has written a total of four articles since he began his career as a journalist in May, yet for The Guardian, The Washington Post and others, he quickly became their man on the ground in Nicaragua despite his open friendship and work with well-known opposition leaders. Photos of him with political leaders who openly call for the overthrow of a democratically elected president were posted on his Facebook Page.\r\n\r\nThe most disconcerting fact about Goette-Luciak is a video from June 30th\_during an opposition march in Managua called “March of the Flowers”. \_Amazingly, I had already seen this video – the opposition has tortured over a hundred Sandinistas that we know of, and we are aware of this because they take videos and post them on Facebook. In this video the terrorists are walking along torturing an old man who they accused of being a Sandinista – they call Sandinistas toads and cockroaches; they mark their homes and tell people not to buy at their businesses. And they kidnap, torture and kill them. Luciak was right there as the torture was taking place and he shows up in the video at various points.\r\n\r\nIf Luciak is an objective journalist, why didn’t he write about this torture episode he witnessed up close and personal in one of his articles? Everything he wrote was rabidly anti-Sandinista. Why would the Guardian, the Washington Post, the BBC and NPR print his work? \_There are many very knowledgeable journalists writing about Nicaragua but the mainstream media won’t print their work because they tell the truth – they don’t follow what has come to be the accepted narrative on Nicaragua in the “developed world.”\r\n\r\nMax Blumenthal published a well cited\_<a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/how-an-american-anthropologist-tied-to-us-regime-change-proxies-became-the-msms-man-in-nicaragua/249868/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mintpressnews.com/how-an-american-anthropologist-tied-to-us-regime-change-proxies-became-the-msms-man-in-nicaragua/249868/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539286568769000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnTDtJslwbPgOFwQjiNFHWjGZtaA\">article</a>\_recently that revealed Goette-Luciak’s ties to the MRS (the opposition Sandinista Reform Movement).\r\n\r\nYesterday I read posts on Facebook from many Nicaraguan friends. The message I got from them was that with the video and photos they considered him to be supporting the coup. Non-Nicaraguans have never been allowed to be involved in Nicaraguan politics, much less in encouraging violence. \_Five people wrote: Gringo Go Home!\r\n\r\n<em>Nan McCurdy is from Puebla, Mexico and with the\_United Methodist Missionary. She was a resident of Nicaragua from 1984 t0 2014.</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Following is a letter-to-the-editor written by Goette Luciak’s long-time friend Wyatt Reed who had traveled to Nicaragua with him. None of the publications that printed Goette Luciak’s articles as news have published Reed’s letter.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo the editor,\r\n\r\nAs a longtime friend and former collaborator of your correspondent with the Nicaraguan opposition, I feel compelled to make a few points clear in light of the recent media frenzy over the deportation from Nicaragua of Carl David Goette Luciak. I must be extremely clear: in the six months we lived and worked together in Nicaragua we were both very open about our plan to use our friendships with Nicaraguan opposition figures to push for the end of the Sandinista government and create careers for ourselves as journalists or consultants in the process. We were not CIA—but we were in many ways serving its same historical purpose.\r\n\r\nI must stress that I wish no ill will on Carl David. I’ve known him since middle school, we were best friends for much of our lives, and I want only to set the record straight. Having already spent several years in Nicaragua, I had made connections with multiple prominent anti-government groups and figures at the time of our partnership. And since I introduced him to many of them, I feel compelled to state publicly that any notion we had of being impartial and objective journalists was simply a lie. We arrived together in Managua in January 2016 without prior journalistic experience but with a shared understanding that the Nicaraguan government represented a fundamental betrayal of socialist ideals, and the shared understanding that the ruling Sandinista party should be removed from power.\r\n\r\nIn the time since, I’ve come to understand that regardless of our personal feelings on the Nicaraguan president or government, any illusions we had of being uniquely capable of helping the Nicaraguan people achieve self-determination were ultimately founded in a kind of white savior complex. I left, realizing Americans cannot liberate the Nicaraguan people. Not thirty years ago, when the US government created the Contra army to fight a decade long war against socialist Nicaragua, and not now. Americans can only help destroy their government, and in the process hand power over to the same conservative neoliberals who seek to roll back the Nicaraguan safety net, privatize national resources, and undo a decade of improvements in poverty reduction and healthcare.\r\n\r\nI have many disagreements with the Sandinista party. However, I do not feel that the violent overthrow of their government can in any way benefit working class Nicaraguans. I mourn with them the tragic deaths of the hundreds killed in the gunfights between police and armed opposition. But if the Sandinista government falls we must ask ourselves: how many tens of thousands more will die when the health clinics are closed? How many children will go barefoot, hungry, and uneducated if their welfare state is abolished? They can’t just fly back to the United States. Unlike them, the westerners who bring about “regime change” rarely have to stick around and suffer the consequences.\r\n\r\n<em>Wyatt Reed</em>\r\n<h2><strong>BRIEFS</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Days of rain in Central America associated with Hurricane Michael have caused widespread flooding across the region including Nicaragua.

He said, \"The first thing the hearing judge does is to explain to the accused what he is accused of and the right he has to a lawyer of his own. It is not true that we are on a witch hunt and that the judiciary is being used to punish the people,\" explaining that convictions are based on the facts and the evidence presented by the Prosecutor's Office. Roberto Larios, director general of communications of the Supreme Court also denounced \"the gross campaign of slander, false news and baseless attacks against the Judicial Power by some media outlets engaged in anti-government opposition.\" He referred particularly to the death of Denis Madriz Obando whose murder, despite the denials of his family, is being portrayed as a political murder authored by the government.

BATCA has been in Nicaragua for more than 30 years and we will continue to invest in the country\", Mercado said. Minister of Agriculture (MAG) Edward Centeno reported that export of tobacco totaled US$26.2 million during the first 8 months of this year, 4.3% above the amount registered in the same period of 2017. “Tobacco production has maintained strong dynamism generating 12, 961 formal jobs,\" Centeno said. His Ministry also reported that export of peanuts totaled US$84.2 million during the first 8 months of this year, 1.6% above the amount registered in the same period of 2017. In terms of volume, 1.5 million hundredweights were exported, 9% above the amount recorded in the same period of 2017.

Police recovered two 38-caliber shells at the scene and said they will continue to investigate.
