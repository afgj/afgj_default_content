The reason Venezuelan children need to have their nutrition supplemented is because the US government is trying to overthrow their government, and the weapon of choice is unilateral coercive measures – sanctions – that are explicitly forbidden in the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Manitos Children’s Fund\_ hopes to ship our first 18 ton container of beans to Venezuela by the end of January.
