To understand the political context in which social movements in Nicaragua operate, including its revolutionary history and membership in ALBA, our delegation will also include visits with Nicaraguan officials and citizens.\r\n\r\n<strong>This delegation is organized in partnership through the Via Campesina organizations of Nicaragua, the Friends of the Asociación de Trabajadores del Campo (ATC), and the Alliance for Global Justice.\_</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Cost:</strong> $1250 plus airfare\r\n\r\n<em>Trip fee includes lodging, meals, in-country transport, translation, and staff coordination.\_ Scholarships are available (please contact us for more information).</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>For a flyer to print out and post, click here: </strong><a href=\"http://www.nicanet.org/images/nicaragua-delegation-flyer.pdf\"><strong>http://www.nicanet.org/images/nicaragua-delegation-flyer.pdf</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>\_</strong><strong>For an application or more information, please contact:\_</strong><a href=\"msilto:erikatakeo.atc@gmail.com\">Erika Takeo</a>, Friends of the ATC National Coordinator\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/friendsatc\">www.facebook.com/friendsatc</a></strong>\r\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\"></div>"
