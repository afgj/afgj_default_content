Only President Daniel Ortega’s commitment to peace has prevented an even worse conflict. Almost as disturbing as the extreme sadism of the opposition paramilitaries in Nicaragua is how their supporters and media displace opposition crimes by attributing them to the government. On June 14th Nicaragua’s Commission for Truth Peace and Justice, sworn in by the country’s National Assembly, reported 168 people dead and over 2100 injured.\r\n\r\nWithout assigning blame, the Commission’s figures included 8 police killed with over 200 injured and also reported the appearance of torture and kidnapping among the abuses. Until the extremist opposition provoked the current crisis, such crimes have been unheard of in Nicaragua since the war of the 1980s. Like their counterparts in Venezuela, the Nicaraguan opposition exhibit all the classic characteristics of psychopaths. Opposition political representatives are obsessed with imposing control by force and unwillingness to compromise. Opposition paramilitaries lack any empathy and attack with brutal sadism. The opposition media trademark is relentless, insistent, cynical deception.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday June 16th, 6 people in Managua died in a fire started by opposition paramilitaries. Elsewhere in Managua, two people were murdered, one of them set on fire in the street. Opposition representatives, supporters and media attribute all those deaths at the hands of their paramilitaries, to the government. As a condition of the national dialogue Nicaragua’s police withdrew to their quarters. But opposition paramilitaries then besieged them in Masaya, Matagalpa, Jinotega, Mulukukú and elsewhere, killing and wounding police officers while shamelessly accusing the police of attacking them.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of June 13th, Sandinista student leader Leonel Morales was kidnapped by opposition paramilitaries, tortured, shot and subsequently left for dead dumped in a drainage canal. He was found barely alive and remains in hospital in intensive care. Morales participated in the national dialogue as elected leader of the UNEN student body in the private UPOLI university, until recently a base for opposition paramilitaries and at least one allied criminal gang, whose leaders are now under arrest. On June 15th, health Minister Sonia Castro reported 55 ambulances damaged or stolen, numerous health centers and hospitals damaged and 4 hospitals invaded by opposition paramilitary gangs.\r\n\r\nEven those attacks and abuses the opposition media attribute to the government, along with many attacks on government and municipal offices and dozens of opposition paramilitary murders. Similarly, in contrast to the Nicaraguan Truth Commission’s June 14th incomparably more professional presentation, the June 13th communique of the Inter-American Commission for Human Right restated the systematic false witness of opposition human rights organizations. The IACHR communique avoided any condemnation of opposition paramilitaries and aggressively accused the government of most of the violence.\r\nFor its part the Nicaraguan government energetically condemned the IACHR communique as “biased, not impartial and lacking objectivity by untruthfully attributing to the State deeds it did not commit.” The horrific incidents on the morning of June 16th will be a real test of the IACHR’s veracity. The victims were all Sandinista supporters while the attackers were clearly opposition paramilitaries and associated delinquents. If the IACHR parrots opposition falsehoods that the crimes were committed by supporters of the government, it will greatly undermine confidence not just in the IACHR but in the broader Organization of American States mission of advice and accompaniment.\r\nDespite everything, the national dialogue advanced on June 15th when the government again confirmed its readiness to receive international missions to help solve the country’s political crisis. After much stonewalling, the opposition and the bishops mediating, perhaps influenced by the presence of the new Vatican emissary to Nicaragua, finally accepted the government’s insistence on an agreement to remove the roadblocks paralyzing Nicaragua’s economy. But almost immediately, on the evening of the 15th, the opposition held a press conference in which they denied the roadblocks would be removed. On the morning of the 16th came the horrific terror attacks in Managua. Both events were clearly aimed at sabotaging the national dialogue. Even so, on the afternoon of the 16th, agreement was reached on the agenda for discussion to begin on June 18th of potential electoral and judicial changes.\r\n\r\nThe opposition will probably delay dismantling the roadblocks and continue their terror attacks to extort maximum concessions from the government. But opposition extremists also hope to provoke the use of security forces to clear the roadblocks, kill the national dialogue and offer a pretext for international condemnation or some kind of intervention. This follows the model of the US controlled but volatile opposition in Venezuela. While some observers suggest the US government does not want Nicaragua to collapse, fearing even more migration to the US and increased organized crime, few believe the US power elites and their government worry about the well-being of people in Central America.\r\n\r\nNo single factor explains what is going on in Nicaragua, where a shifting kaleidoscope of interests makes events confusing and unpredictable. While the Sandinista government is negotiating in good faith, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Bob Corker’s June 11th visit to Managua offered another example of splits between mainstream US Republicans, the erratic Trump administration and the sinister US anti-Cuban mafia supporting Nicaragua’s opposition extremists. Nicaragua has strong relations with Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, whose business communities are probably lobbying against destabilizing Nicaragua. Caribbean nations in the OAS are probably also defending Nicaragua, just as most of them have defended Cuba and Venezuela.\r\nSince the Nicaraguan opposition are as divided as their Venezuelan opposition counterparts, it may suit the US elites not to push for elusive outright regime change. The US elites’ Nicaraguan allies provoked the current crisis because they have failed electorally. By insisting on a political solution instead of deploying the country’s security forces, the Sandinista government has probably kept intact Nicaragua’s recent structural electoral loyalties whereby around 50% support the FSLN, 30%-35% support the opposition and 15%-20% are independent. The opposition need all the independent votes to win the Presidency or a majority in the legislature, theoretically possible but hardly likely.\r\n\r\nThe national dialogue is discussing bringing forward the elections scheduled for 2021 and external factors like US sanctions or OAS intervention will tip Nicaragua's electoral politics in favor of the opposition. But the crisis may backfire against the opposition in electoral terms depending how susceptible people are to the constant psychological warfare. The opposition do not have a viable candidate nor do they have any social policy proposals, while their economic proposals have been banal, self-serving neoliberal gobbledygook. So the opposition may choose to argue for elections in late 2019 or early 2020, giving US elites time to create the necessary electoral conditions for an opposition victory.\r\n\r\nAnother obviously important factor in electoral calculations is security and organized crime. For the foreseeable future, the extremist opposition will continue a policy of provocative attacks and intimidation, creating uncertainty and insecurity that may shape electoral intentions in unpredictable ways. Security policy counteracting organized crime and opposition terrorist violence should work in favor of the government because people want peace and stability. More fundamentally, the government will focus on domestic productivity and ensuring food security to counter economic consequences of the crisis such as higher unemployment, more migration, lower investment, capital flight and higher business costs resulting from the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe government will also try and shape patterns of consumption and investment so as to prevent a damaging balance of payments crisis forcing resort to the International Monetary Fund. Another obvious intention of the US instigated crisis has been to attack the popular economy and the government's capacity to maintain subsidies. Cuts in current subsidies to electricity and transport for low income families would seriously diminish the value of the annual minimum wage increases since 2007. The same applies to the government’s successful social programs, health care and education. All these factors will affect any electoral outcome.\r\n\r\nThe current crisis in Nicaragua is an intense escalation of long term US and allied strategy to destroy the Sandinista Front for National Liberation, very much part of the unrelenting regional assault on Cuba and Venezuela. The US elites’ defeat in Eurasia forces them to consolidate control in the Americas and prevent a Chinese controlled Nicaraguan canal, as well as countering Russian influence. The US elites also want to crush Nicaragua’s economically successful, socialist inspired, redistributive popular economy and its integrationist regional policy which threatens US control.\r\nThe US power elites' failure overthrow Venezuela’s government has made changing or weakening Nicaragua’s Sandinista government more urgent. Regime change in Nicaragua would also remove its obstruction of global US and allied foreign policy goals in relation to, for example, Venezuela and Cuba or Palestine and Iran. The current coup attempt in Nicaragua is not merely a short-term political event but rather an intensification of the US elites’ permanent war on the impoverished majority in Latin America. The immediate priority for Nicaragua’s Sandinista government is to avoid armed conflict, achieve a peaceful settlement and endure.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM\r\n[I am including an English translation of this helpful analysis by Informe Pastran on June 18 of what they identify as three blocs, or tendencies, within the opposition. Understanding these differing intentions will help outside observers make sense of advances and retreats in the dialogue process and increases and decreases in opposition street violence. Many of the acronyms, especially of the political parties, will be unfamiliar to readers. I’ll add translation of the important ones, but many represent such small political configurations that most Nicaraguans probably don’t remember what they stand for! The most important one is FAD-MRS which is the alliance of former US-backed presidential candidate Eduardo Montealegre, who was defeated by President Daniel Ortega in 2006, and the Sandinista Renovation Movement which split off from the Sandinista Party in 1994 and has moved progressively to the right ever since.]\r\n\r\nTHREE BLOCKS, THREE OPPOSITION VISIONS In the last few hours, it has become evident that there are now three blocs within the opposition with three different visions and that they are already being preparing for the new future electoral scenarios. The first is the Civic Alliance for Democracy and Justice, which includes businessmen, university students, a portion of civil society NGOs, and the anti-canal movement. This bloc advocates a peaceful and constitutional way out of the current national crisis and is preparing to become an electoral alternative. The second bloc is comprised of the FAD-MRS party and Liberal Party dissidents, a group of social movements and NGOs in which the MRS has a strong influence, and also the Sandinista Rescue Movement. This bloc pushes the idea of ​​an immediate resignation of the government and the creation of a governing junta [chosen by them].\r\n\r\nTHE EXCLUDED ONES The third block is made up of political parties which have continued to participate in governmental institutions but are completely excluded from the National Dialogue. They include the PLC [Constitutional Liberal Party which has the second largest caucus in the National Assembly], the Conservative Party, APRE [formed by ex-President Enrique Bolaños], the PLI [the Liberal party that split from Somoza in 1944 and which Montealegre captured and then lost when the traditional leadership sued to recover control], PRN, PLN, MLCI, PSC, National Restoration Party, Christian Path, Christian Unity, and Citizens for Freedom (CxL), and other small movements. With the constitutional and electoral reforms [promoted by the other two blocs] and the proposal to advance the elections and unify the opposition, the losers among the opposition would be the PLC which, with all its mayors and deputies, would cease to be the second strongest national political force; CxL because it would lose its mayors and the Conservative Party its municipal councilors. The first two blocks do not want any alliance with the PLC or the conservatives, nor other groups of former contras, nor Evangelicals.\r\n\r\nALLIANCE PREPARES In tandem with the demands they make in the national dialogue, the Civic Alliance for Democracy, which includes the entrepreneurs, a sector of civil society, students and the anti-canal movement, are projecting an eventual electoral process. Over the weekend, they began to release a video on social networks where they describe a political program of networks for security, protection and supply, that is to say its social base, with the formation of committees \"to support the security and welfare of the community\" promising “a new Nicaragua\". Other Civic Alliance leaders have criticized student leaders Lester Alemán and Víctor Cuadras for declaring themselves Sandinistas and claiming that they want to follow in the footsteps of the founder of the FSLN, Carlos Fonseca Amador, but it is clear that that is a strategy to capture dissenting Sandinistas towards the cause of the alliance.\r\n\r\nINSISTING ON GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION The bloc called \"Articulation of Social Movements and Organizations of Civil Society,\" the FAD-MRS group, opposes a way out negotiated in the dialogue and has called on supporters to increase the number of road blocks in the country and to overthrow the Sandinista government. This bloc has presented the Civic Alliance with a proposal of what should be done called \"Route towards democratization,” in which they insist on immediate resignation of the Government and creation of a Transitional Government that would convene a National Constituent Assembly and subsequent new elections."
