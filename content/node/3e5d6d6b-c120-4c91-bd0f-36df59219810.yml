It opened\_earlier, playing at the mall in Managua. Never being one to pass\_up air-conditioning, I went, munched popcorn and thoroughly\_enjoyed it, as did the Nicaraguan audience that filled the theater.\_Their laughter was a couple of seconds delayed because they\_were reading subtitles, but it was loud and enthusiastic.\_“American Made” is about gun running, drug trafficking, money\_laundering and dirty deeds in general out of the CIA and the\_White House during the Reagan administration. Much of it takes\_place in Nicaragua, although apparently the Nicaraguan\_locations were actually filmed in\_<a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=LHRuFq4pDsHYLxeCksWFrnoL1wl%2BEn6r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v%3D2%26c%3DLHRuFq4pDsHYLxeCksWFrnoL1wl%252BEn6r&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1507319815048000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm6drlH8ZbquWch0672uRFpxtWGw\">Columbia</a>.\n\nIn order to enjoy this movie, you will need to adjust your\_expectations in two ways. First, you’ll have to accept that farce is\_the correct genre for portraying the Reagan era, the illegal\_Contra War, and the war on drugs. If you’re more of a Truthout\_kind of person and you don’t think imperialism is a laughing\_matter, you may want to pass on this flick. However, I would\_argue that the sequences of scenes that leads into a news clip of\_Nancy Reagan declaring the administration’s drug policy to be\_“Just Say No!” Is comic gold and not to be missed.\n\nThe second mental adjustment needed before seeing “American\_Made” is to recognize that not a word of it is true. This\_comedy/adventure yarn is laid over real events, the chronology\_matches more or less, and the characters share names with real\_people (Barry Seal, Pablo Escobar, Oliver North, etc.) but the\_places where the movie and reality are congruent are\_nonexistent. The character Tom Cruise creates is sexy, athletic,\_hyperkinetic, easily bored, not too bright, disinclined to think\_through anything, generous, and, despite his many crimes, a\_likable guy. For my money, it is an excellent job of acting.\_However, there is no reason to think the real Barry Seal was any\_of these things. On the other hand, you can put money on the\_real Seal’s life being more violent, scummier, uglier, scarier,\_meaner, and way less entertaining than the one led by Tom\_Cruise on the screen.\n\nSimilarly, off the mark is the movie’s unambiguous presentation\_of the Sandinistas having a direct hand in Pablo Escobar’s\_trafficking of drugs out of Nicaragua in the 80s. This sequence\_concerns a White House sting operation, totally illegal and\_unethical in and of itself, to get photos that would prove the\_government of Nicaragua was directly assisting Escobar’s\_operation. Much was made of these photos by the Reagan\_administration, but in fact they proved nothing and were at best\_inconclusive. “Wall Street Journal reporter\_Jonathan Kwitny\_threw\_doubt over Seal’s accusations, claiming there was no evidence\_tying any Nicaraguan officials to the drug shipment.”\n\nOn the other hand there is no question that the US-backed\_Contras and their CIA handlers were up to their armpits in the\_cocaine trafficking. The documentation of their involvement in\_introducing crack cocaine to Los Angeles isn't even disputed.\_That crime led to an epidemic in the US that devastated political\_organizing in the inner cities and cost urban African Americans a\_whole generation. Along the same lines, the movie ends with\_assassins sent by the Columbians killing Seal. However, people\_who have looked closely at the story conclude that it is just as\_likely that\_the hit\_was ordered and orchestrated by the CIA, The\_White House, and/or the Bush family.\n\nIn watching this movie, it is important to remember and to tell\_others, that Nicaragua has not suffered from the effects of drug\_trafficking that have devastated most of Central America. In\_contrast to the northern triangle countries of Honduras, El\_Salvador, and Guatemala, with their close affiliation with the US,\_Nicaragua is safe and secure. President Daniel Ortega is\_personally so anti-drug, that he joins with the US in blocking any\_discussion of decriminalization of even marijuana in Latin\_American and international forums. The Nicaraguan police and\_military are the least corrupt in Central America and among the\_least corrupt in the world.\n\nI say, go to the local megaplex, buy a ticket and some popcorn,\_fasten your seatbelt, enjoy the action and the laughs, get a peek\_at Tom Cruise’s butt (twice!), appreciate “American Made” for\_what it is, a Hollywood action comedy flick, and don’t believe a\_word of it. Then go home and read any of the well written\_exposes of the Iran/Contra war and the dirty dealings in the\_Reagan White House.

The vote was characterized by one Representative as a\_“retirement gift” to far right Miami Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The Nicaraguan government condemned the bill. “This bill is a\_flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan people and a denial\_of all political, social, cultural and economic processes undertaken to\_promote peace, security and the well-being of all Nicaraguans,” the\_government statement said.
