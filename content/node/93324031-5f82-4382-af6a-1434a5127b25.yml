What the people do not need, or want, is another war.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The U.S. has built up a tremendous force in the waters north of the country. “We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft, and helicopters; Coast Guard cutters; and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region.”Officials at the Defense Department reportedly opposed the deployment, as the military has struggled with the spread of COVID-19. But their concerns were ignored.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The president claims that the operation is meant to combat drug trafficking, primarily cocaine smuggling, but such a force has never been previously deployed solely for drugs. And data from the U.S. government’s own Consolidated Counterdrug Database shows that Venezuela is not a primary transit country for U.S.-bound cocaine. Six times as much cocaine passed through Guatemala in recent years. Our government should focus on the more pressing needs of its own people, who are trying to make it through the most significant crisis the country has faced in decades.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://orinocotribune.com/amb-moncada-denounces-trump-at-the-un-for-his-genocidal-policy-towards-venezuelans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orinocotribune.com/amb-moncada-denounces-trump-at-the-un-for-his-genocidal-policy-towards-venezuelans/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423677000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGvTEISBfqJ-jRU-XoVpWT9QiZtQ\">OrinocoTribune: Ambassador Moncada Denounces Trump at the UN for his “Genocidal Policy” Towards Venezuelans</a> Moncada denounced the “genocidal” management of the United States to the UN Security Council for using “the pandemic as a weapon against Caracas.” Since at least 2015, the US, UK and other allied countries have imposed various illegal sanctions, “in an illegal action that repeats itself in the XXI century, the same acts of colonialism that characterized the nineteenth century.”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://orinocotribune.com/now-the-us-navy-intimidates-venezuelan-fishing-vessel-in-international-waters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orinocotribune.com/now-the-us-navy-intimidates-venezuelan-fishing-vessel-in-international-waters/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423677000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8RfmOIgyT1Ylm4tHFTcPYVR0a2A\">Orinoco Tribune: Now the US Navy Intimidates Venezuelan Fishing Vessel in International Waters</a>\r\nA Venezuelan fishing vessel was boarded in the Pacific Ocean by the US Coast Guard.

At the same time, the regime has used the crisis to mount an authoritarian crackdown. While those who breach curfew and quarantine measures risk up to 10 years’ imprisonment, the government has done nothing to guarantee financial assistance or even job security for workers. This has led to riots throughout the working class suburbs in El Alto and Oruro, and at least 1,200 arrests. This is in addition to the persecution of hundreds of social activists and militants of Morales’s Movement for Socialism (MAS) over the past few months.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/latam/202004251079085132-bolivian-govt-mishandles-covid-19-crisis-steps-up-persecution-of-morales-supporters---journo/?fbclid=IwAR3XmkVvIWrLOTInqeJGZJfqHCuOmGcK6Fi2mquXqSw0Nz03lqbM9CjhIsk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sputniknews.com/latam/202004251079085132-bolivian-govt-mishandles-covid-19-crisis-steps-up-persecution-of-morales-supporters---journo/?fbclid%3DIwAR3XmkVvIWrLOTInqeJGZJfqHCuOmGcK6Fi2mquXqSw0Nz03lqbM9CjhIsk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPz9AX3XveGF2nT6aaMSPiD5Rr5g\">Sputnik News: Bolivian Gov't Mishandles COVID-19 Crisis, Steps Up Persecution of Morales' Supporters</a> Bolivia's de facto government headed by Jeanine Anez has intensified the persecution of Evo Morales' partisans and left-leaning movements under the smokescreen of quarantine measures, says La Resistencia Bolivia journalist Alberto Echazu, denouncing La Paz' response to the COVID-19 crisis as highly insufficient.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Webinar\r\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/580289332601022/?active_tab=about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/events/580289332601022/?active_tab%3Dabout&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNES_qIw09CWE2IXjYeF6PmSIneM8g\">May 2: Celebrate May Day - Solidarity, Not Sanctions and Blockades in the Struggle Against Covid-19 - from Cuba, South Africa, Venezuela, NY nurses, CUPW</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sites to Follow Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua:\r\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/StandwithVenezuela/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/StandwithVenezuela/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbQz4yFddNQSFLGqR43vMRINwT1Q\">Stand with Venezuela</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://orinocotribune.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orinocotribune.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHnYTWDfntTHJqLNmrGemzEpoAXg\">Orinoco Tribune</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/162591360580435/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/162591360580435/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoXQsYp-JKzgcl9aC2eYl-ZIxSHA\">Venezuela Solidarity New York</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EndVenezuelaSanctions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/EndVenezuelaSanctions/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF0AmLQOiFqZFEL_TKormmtsLgm5g\">End Venezuela Sanctions</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SandinistaNicaraguaFriends/?ref=bookmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/SandinistaNicaraguaFriends/?ref%3Dbookmarks&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlxFRNYhmVmvoMIXDdsojdtchO3g\">Friends of Sandinista Nicaragua</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofEvosBolivia/?ref=bookmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofEvosBolivia/?ref%3Dbookmarks&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvMPw0cO82ccA3bH8YWTfP5EJ2_Q\">Friends of Evo’s Bolivia</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofEcuadorNorthAmerica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofEcuadorNorthAmerica/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588451423678000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKfVgigim-aJHnHpQZ_DiZ0Apr8w\">Friends of Ecuador - North America</a></p>"
