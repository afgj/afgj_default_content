Nicaragua is one of several countries that have diplomatic relations with the two new countries. Presidential Economic Advisor\_Bayardo Arce responded to reporters’ questions about the effect of the language on US aid to Nicaragua. Arce said, “The United States government does not\_give anything to the government of Nicaragua as far as I know. I think there is some military aid, which I would say is a rather bad payment for the big favor we\_do them by stopping trafficking of the drugs that they consume in large quantities.” (Informe Pastran, May 12)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li>Nicaragua Foreign Minister Denis Moncada and the Minister of Cooperation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Romain Schneider, signed a US$39\_million aid agreement May 9 in Managua. The funding will be used for the development of new projects in strategic sectors such as health, education and\_tourism. Schneider said that his country has increased the amount of cooperation with Nicaragua from US$31 to US$39 million dollars.

Rivas also confirmed that the Organization of American States\_(OAS) will accompany the November municipal elections, as part of the agreements signed with the Nicaragua government. Earlier this year, the OAS ratified\_that they are working with the Nicaragua government to strengthen democracy and improve electoral processes in the country. Foreign Minister Denis Moncada\_also confirmed the OAS role which has angered the portion of the opposition that boycotted last year’s presidential election. The OAS participation will make it\_hard for the opposition to attack the legitimacy of the outcome.

We will be making similar efforts in different countries to showcase and promote our volcanoes, beaches and nature reserves,\"\_García said.

The visiting ships contained 62,517 passengers of which 32,826 visited at least one tourist attraction. A total of\_1.5 million foreign tourists visited Nicaragua in 2016, leaving behind US$642 million in foreign currency, more than the country brings in from coffee or beef\_exports.
