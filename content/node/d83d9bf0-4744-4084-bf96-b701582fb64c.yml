In this course, activists will be taught the key precepts of journalism, specifically writing for the web, developing sources, doing background research and how to have their work be read by a wider audience. Readings will include exemplary pieces of journalism on militarization and social movements in Latin America and the U.S., as well as journalism, research and publication tip sheets.\r\n\r\n<strong>Skills/understanding that activists will have for organizing and opposing militarism after taking this course:</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Research and writing skills</li>\r\n\t<li>Understanding of how to develop sources</li>\r\n\t<li>Knowledge of the various options that exist for publishing and self-publishing online</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>About the Instructor: Meet Dawn Paley</strong>\r\nDawn Paley has been working as a freelance journalist for the last eight years, six of which she has focused on Latin America.
