Given these priorities, you would think that Nicaragua would be the US’s best\_friend, since relatively few Nicaraguans emigrate north, Nicaragua’s role in the international\_movement of drugs is minor, there is little gang activity, political corruption is no worse in Nicaragua\_than anywhere else in Central America, and, perhaps most important to Nicaraguans, it is a safe\_country in sharp contrast to its neighbors to the north. Our government’s knee jerk, anti-leftist\_orientation keeps us from appreciating Nicaragua’s achievements and keeps us locked into failed\_policies. The war on drugs, militarization of civil society, and a rampant anti-immigrant stance are\_examples of approaches we have poured billions into with no success. If there was any openness to\_rethinking things that don’t work, the contrast between Nicaragua and the Northern Triangle\_countries would be a good place to start looking.</p>\nMuch top down journalism and study have been devoted to these issues. However, in hopes of\_getting a different perspective, I’ve been talking to people living in Nicaragua and asking the\_question, “Why is Nicaragua so much safer than the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El\_Salvador and Guatemala?” These conversations were not recorded, so I am reporting the content,\_but not in direct quotes. Some people asked me not to use their real names. I’m also offering other\_sources of information that relate to what was shared in the conversations.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maria</strong>\nMaria is a bright, energetic Nicaraguan woman who manages grants for a development agency.\_When I ask her this question she tells me it is all about immigration. People from those countries go\_North. It is very dangerous and many never come back. They leave the children with the\_grandparents and the grandparents don’t have the energy to supervise them. There are many\_children growing up without guidance. Their parents invest so much in getting to the US they can’t\_take the risk of coming home. They can call and send money, but their children won’t see them for\_years, sometimes never again. And so in those countries the children grow up without discipline,\_without knowing right from wrong. But people from Nicaragua go South. We go to Costa Rica or\_Panama. You just go to the Costa Rican embassy. Maybe you have to spend hours or days in a line,\_but it is easy. And you can come home, too. You can be a part of the family, send some money, but\_also be with your children for Christmas. They grow up as part of a family and know right from\_wrong.</p>\n(<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-nicaragua-no-migrants-20140830-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A\_recent article\_in the Los Angeles Times</a> reinforces and expands Maria’s thinking about patterns of\_immigration as an important explanation for the safety found in Nicaragua. The piece points out that\_even within the US the area of settlement can hold consequences, “Nicaraguans tended to settle in\_Miami and New Orleans, while Salvadorans went to Los Angeles and were sucked into a booming\_and bloody gang culture. They would be the first people the U.S. started deporting back to Central\_America in the early 1990s.”)\n\n<strong>Sarah</strong>\nSarah is an American woman married to a Honduran man. Her husband comes from Tocoa,\_Honduras, an area saturated with drugs and violence. The couple have lived in Honduras and\_Nicaragua. They are moving to the US for a job for Sarah, but hope to return permanently to\_Nicaragua. Sarah says she only knows Honduras, but thinks it is the presence of the US military.\_There is a huge US base and the military is the face of the US in Honduras. The aid that Honduras\_receives from the US is military aid. At the municipal level the police are OK. They try to help you.\_But at the national level, the police are more and more militarized. You can’t tell the police from the\_army, and everyone says all of them, the police, the army, and the government are involved in the\_drug trade. The big drug kingpin from Tocoa is in jail in the United States, but the people say that\_only happened because someone more powerful was consolidating their territory.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(Much of what Sarah says is confirmed by<a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/04/02/honduran-drug-lord-cuts-deal-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\_news reports</a>\_about Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga and\_his brother Javier, heads of the violent drug cartel called Los Cachiros from Tocoa. Also the justice\_department has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/25/us-honduras-drug-enforcement-administration-shooting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\_confirmed</a> the direct involvement of the US Drug Enforcement Administration in the\_murder of civilians during a training operation with the Honduran military.)</p>\n<strong>Miguel</strong>\nMiguel is a friendly, outgoing guy who runs a tour company. He learned much of his English hanging\_out with surfers on Nicaragua’s various Pacific beaches. He speaks in a distinctive, slangy manner\_that wouldn’t be out of place on Mission Beach in San Diego. Because he is boyish and fun loving, it\_would be possible to mistake Miguel for a lightweight. That would be a mistake. He is actually a\_thoughtful, knowledgeable man, whose opinions are worth listening to. Miguel’s first thoughts on the\_question are, man, we are such a poor country. Everyone is poor here. There is nothing here for\_criminals. In Nicaragua maybe you could make money off of agriculture, or workers who will work for\_nothing, or maybe tourism, but that’s not stuff criminals are interested in. He thinks for a while then\_adds that there is more to it, too. We had the revolution and the war and everybody was military,\_then later the military became the cops. These were people who had fought for the country and\_whose brothers died in the war. After the sacrifice of the martyrs, they didn’t want to see anything\_bad happen to Nicaragua. All those gangs in the other countries came out of the US; guys who were\_in prison in the US, got into the gangs, and then got sent back. In Honduras and El Salvador they\_started up M-18, MS-13 all that. In Nicaragua everybody knows everybody. If somebody like that\_showed up, they wouldn’t last long.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(Miguel’s ideas are very similar to\_<a href=\"http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/26/how-nicaragua-fights-to-keep-the-gangs-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">media reports</a>\_and\_<a href=\"http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/3351\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">academic research</a>.)</p>\n<strong>Luis</strong>\nLuis works as a security guard and handyman in a small apartment complex in an upscale\_neighborhood in Managua. His small shack on the corner, outfitted with a hammock and a TV, is an\_informal social club for guys working in the neighborhood. There is often someone repairing a car or\_motorcycle or refinishing a piece of furniture in the shade of the trees. Luis takes a break from\_trimming trees to answer my question. “Look,” he says, “this government that we have now is very\_organized and integrated.” The police, the army, the courts, everyone is on the same team and the\_people are part of that. Have you heard of CPC? (Consejos de Poder Ciudadano/ Citizen Power\_Committees) Every neighborhood is organized and connected to the police and the government. In\_this neighborhood you don’t need it because people can afford private security, but in poor\_neighborhoods it is very important.\n\nThere are a few people who are the eyes and ears of the police. They know what is going on and if\_there is something not right they will inform the police and the police will take care of it. (He makes\_the hand gesture for someone going away, leaving the situation.) Also they get the community\_together to solve problems. In some neighborhoods, at night, a man is walking around keeping an\_eye on things. He blows a whistle and that lets people know he is there and if somebody is thinking\_about committing a crime they will see it is not a good idea. Sure there is crime in Nicaragua, but it is\_little stuff. Some kid on a motorcycle might snatch your backpack or your cell phone, but they are not\_going to kill you. It is a safe place. Be calm. Don’t worry.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(In my conversations, several people mentioned\_Consejos de Poder Ciudadano. Opponents of the\_government, including the opposition newspaper, La Prensa, are very\_<a href=\"http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/05/16/politica/24768-de-los-cds-a-los-cpc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">critical</a>\_of this form of\_community policing. \_They describe it as repressive, “big brother is watching,” government control\_that is ripe for abuse and favoritism. However, the people I talked to, certainly a small sample, were\_not concerned. Rather they spoke with pride about the role of CPC in the safety and security their\_country has achieved.)</p>\nGiven the long history and the entrenchment of the problems, it may be too late to have much\_optimism about Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. However, the situation in Nicaragua is very\_hopeful. Of course there are no easy solutions, but the example of Nicaragua suggests that the way\_forward is an integrated, cohesive society in which the people are partners with the police and other\_government entities in keeping their communities safe. This echoes the success of community\_policing projects in the US and elsewhere.\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">BRIEFS</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">The Nicaragua Central Bank announced that formal employment as of July this year, grew 7% over the same\_period in 2016. The report also noted that a total of 919,469 workers are part of the Nicaragua Social Security Institute\_(INSS) which means they have formal jobs that pay into social security. Sectors such as commerce (14.5%); mining\_(12.3%); agriculture (9.4%); and construction (8.1%) are among the main drivers of this growth in formal employment.\_(Nicaragua News, Sept. 14)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>US President Donald Trump sent a congratulatory message to President Daniel Ortega on the occasion of\_Nicaragua’s Independence Day celebration. In his message the US President said, “As you celebrate your Independence,\_the people of the United States join me in sending our best wishes to the Nicaraguan people. The United States looks\_forward to deepening our relationship with Nicaragua to achieve a more democratic, prosperous and secure future.” \_This\_does not sound like a message from a president who is ready to support the NICA Act which would cut Nicaragua off from\_international loans. (Nicaragua News, Sept. 13)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>UThe Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) announced that the government has approved the signing of two loans\_totaling US$172 million to finance electricity projects in rural areas. The first is a US$161.5 million loan approved by the\_Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and the second, a US$10.5 million loan from the OPEC Fund\_for International Development (OFID). (Nicaragua News, Sept. 13)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>UNational Police Chief Aminta Granera stated that this year the homicide rate in Nicaragua was reduced from 7 to\_6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The Police Chief added that 62% of the country did not report any homicides, which represents\_a very significant achievement in the strengthening of public safety. \"This result confirms that Nicaragua is the safest\_country in Central America and one of the safest in Latin America,\" Granera said. (Nicaragua News, Sept. 12)</li>\n \t<li>Ricardo Melendez, vice president of the Nicaragua Chamber of Housing \_(CADUR), said the construction sector\_is investing more than US$100 million in the construction of multi-story buildings this year. He added that the strong\_dynamism in the construction sector is driven by greater economic growth, strengthening of legal certainty and new public\_- private investments. (Nicaragua News, Sept. 12)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>UWorld Bank Country Representative Luis Constantino said Nicaragua is the third fastest growing economy in\_Latin America and is one of the countries that has made significant progress in the fight against poverty. \"This economic\_growth is remarkable because it includes a significant reduction of poverty and inequality gaps. The Bank wants to\_continue to support the efforts of the Nicaragua government,” Constantino said. (Nicaragua News, Sept. 11)</li>\n</ul>"
