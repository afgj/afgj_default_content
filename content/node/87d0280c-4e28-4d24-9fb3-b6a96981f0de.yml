You know, I expect politicians to lie to me, but when the lies come\_from people I once respected and considered compañer@s, the betrayal seems so much worse. The email didn’t\_come with a web link, and I couldn’t find it during a brief scan of the MRS web page, so I can’t share the content with\_you. They did thoughtfully translate their screed into English, making me wonder who the intended audience was.\_Not that many Nicaraguan voters would choose to read their declaration in English.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Normally it wouldn’t make much sense to react to an analysis from a political “party” whose level of support makes\_the US Green Party look like a major contender. The MRS isn’t even a registered party because they don’t have\_enough support to elect local party officers in the required number of Nicaragua’s municipalities. However, they do\_operate in coalition with corrupt banker Eduardo Montealegre, who was the US-backed losing candidate in the 2006\_election. But more important, many people in the US who used to be solidarity activists, and are likely still activists in\_many critical movements, don’t know how far to the right the MRS has gone since its 1994 formation by dissident\_Sandinistas.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Indeed, one wouldn’t know it from their description of themselves: “The Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) is a\_Nicaraguan political party of the democratic left that promotes a society with opportunities, progress, solidarity,\_democracy, and sovereignty.” I guess they forgot the “sovereignty” part when MRS President Ana Vijil, joined right-wing parties in Washington, DC to ask ultra-conservative Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen to\_sponsor the NICA Act in the last Congress. The NICA Act would require the US to vote against multilateral loans to\_Nicaragua. Long ago they forgot the Left part. I remember in 2006 asking MRS leader Enrique Saenz what the\_MRS’s plan was for building a grassroots party to challenge the Sandinista Party (FSLN) from the Left. Apparently he\_didn’t understand the question because his answer was all about what they were doing to build a coalition with right-wing parties.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I was even more offended in a meeting with their executive leadership in 2013 where they subjected us to a slick\_PowerPoint presentation purporting to prove that the Ortega government hadn’t spent\_<strong>anything</strong>\_on reducing poverty\_or resurrecting the peasant agriculture sector. About midway through the presentation I realized that they were\_making the claim based on leaving out all the Venezuela oil aid and the non-dollar cooperative trade among the\_ALBA countries, the very sources of funding for the amazing progress the Ortega government has made to\_recuperate the social and economic rights of the poor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Their new communique,\_<strong>Nicaragua 2017: Crisis and Opportunity</strong>,\_is very much in the style of the PowerPoint, or\_maybe a better comparison is with the Trump spokeswoman who coined the phrase, “We have alternative facts.” I’m\_sorry. You can have policy differences, but you can’t have alternative facts. The MRS cannot credibly say the\_“presidential inauguration” (their quotes) was a “mere formality” an “electoral farce and fraud…without any type of\_legitimacy.” Nicaragua’s election met international electoral norms and Daniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote, right in\_line with what independent polls were showing ahead of the election.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The MRS calls Ortega and his wife and vice-president Rosario Murillo, “leaders of a dynasty.” Just google the word\_dynasty. Every dictionary definition requires at least a succession, a sequence, a series of leaders and a long time\_period. None of those conditions have been met but the word dynasty sounds nasty, so that’s the word the MRS\_uses. Besides, whoever becomes president, however many times, can only do it by being nominated by their party\_and by winning the most votes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The communique also accused Ortega of banning international observers. This is a total falsehood. The election was\_observed by electoral experts and parliamentarians from throughout Latin America and by invited individuals with\_international credibility such as Brian Willson from the US whose\_<strong><a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes20\" target=\"_blank\">report</a></strong>\_we ran in this space on November 25.\_Groups that weren’t invited were the National Endowment for Democracy, the European Union, and others who have\_records of declaring deeply flawed elections, such as Honduras’ 2013 election, as free and fair while reports of\_serious fraud were still coming in and the polls hadn’t closed. There was a time when international monitoring served\_an important purpose for countries transitioning from dictatorship to democracy. But in the years since, too often\_international observation has been merely a tool to certify friends of the US and delegitimize its enemies.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I want to thank tortilla con sal for helping me to understand the MRS’s next two false claims; first that Ortega\_removed 28 members of the National Assembly, and second their claim that the abstention rate “reached more than\_70%.” (I highly recommend\_<a href=\"http://www.tortillaconsal.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.tortillaconsal.com</a>\_for Latin America political analysis.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The MRS propaganda depends on the fact that even those of us who follow Nicaragua closely don’t have a very\_solid understanding of the country’s political system and institutions. I wrote a whole\_<a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes5\">blog</a>\_about the removal of\_National Assembly members on August 3. But to summarize, last summer the Nicaraguan Supreme Court ruled on a\_long-standing complaint filed by the historical leadership of the Independent Liberal Party (PLI) against Montealegre\_for illegally taking over the party so he had ballot access to run for president in 2006. The Court handed back control\_of the party to its old leadership which dates back to the 1940s when the PLI courageously split with the Somoza\_dictatorship and became an opposition party. Montealegre and 20 other of the 28 PLI deputies refused to\_acknowledge the leadership or to turn over the party financial records. \_Deputies in the National Assembly, which the\_MRS calls Congress, are elected by party slate, not as individuals as is the case in the US. So the PLI leadership\_replaced the 21 who were in rebellion and reaffirmed the seven who accepted the party leadership. All this took place\_internally within the PLI. Ortega didn’t replace anyone, and not all the PLI deputies followed Montealegre out of the\_party. So, the number 28 is an inflated figure, and the process did not involve the Executive Branch at all. In fact, at\_the end of the process, the PLI still had 28 seats in the legislature and it remained in opposition to the majority\_Sandinistas.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But the claim that over 70% of voters abstained is the most absurd of all because anyone can visit the Supreme\_Electoral Council’s (CSE) web site and see the turnout for yourself. You will see some urban voting stations with\_abstention levels as high as 70%, but you’ll find many more with voting levels in the 80 and 90 percentile. Total\_turnout, based on valid votes was 65.3% according to the CSE. That was as much as 10% below normal turnout\_which the MRS and its right-wing allies could take credit for since they called for the electorate to boycott the\_election, but to claim that only 30% voted is one of those pesky “alternative facts” the MRS is so fond of.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The MRS communique next goes on to say that in the National Assembly “Ortega has secured a majority of 70% and\_has assigned the other 30% to unconditional allies.” Actually, the Sandinista legislative ticket polled about 76% of the\_vote winning the FSLN 70 of the 90 seats up for election. Opposition parties that ignored Montealegre and the MRS’s\_boycott call won the other seats in proportion to their vote. Ortega had nothing to do with the proportions or which\_individuals represent their opposition parties in the legislature. Of course, the MRS doesn’t recognize the parties that\_can actually attract votes at the polls as “true opposition forces.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The MRS communique ends with threats it perceives to the Ortega government. A real head scratcher is the one\_about how Ortega might die! So might we all, but unlike us as individuals, democratic governments have lines of\_succession. I certainly wish Daniel Ortega a long and productive life. But if it were cut short, I have no doubt that the\_succession would be smooth and the government program he set in place would continue. The other head scratcher\_was the implication that there is a lot of corruption in the handling of international aid. The World Bank has rated\_Nicaragua as the number one country for “execution of projects.” That is only possible because there is so much less\_corruption in Nicaragua than in most other countries.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, they get to the real kicker citing the threat of the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act (NICA Act), the very\_act that the MRS lobbied the US Congress to pass! If it did, it would destroy Nicaragua’s growing economy. Here\_they show the same ignorance of the US political system and institutions as they depend on us to have about theirs.\_The NICA Act passed the House of Representatives late in the election season as part of the “consent agenda.” That\_means it was packaged with a bunch of other bills and passed without a voice or recorded vote. It passed that way\_because it was just a smoke and mirrors bill for Ros-Lehtinen’s right-wing Cuban constituency in Miami. Everybody\_knew it wasn’t going to be taken up by the Senate, much less signed by President Obama.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, the election didn’t turn out as everyone expected so with the Republicans controlling both chambers of\_Congress and the White House, there is a possibility it could go all the way through now. The bill sponsors would\_have to start all over again because we now have a new Congress so in the House it would have to go to committee,\_get voted out, and be passed by the House. Then it would go to the Senate which may or may not do anything with\_it. If the Senate passes it, it would go to the president for signature. Would the Trump administration and the top\_leadership of Congress be so stupid as to destroy Nicaragua’s economy and unleash a wave of immigrants heading\_straight for the US?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It is too early to know, but the Nicaragua Network/AfGJ will be ready to fight it if it is reintroduced in the new\_Congress. \_I would assume that the parties that brought this economic disaster down on Nicaragua would pretty\_much be toast as far as Nicaraguan voters are concerned. How many Nicaraguans are willing to crash their own\_economy because they don’t like Daniel and Rosario? Since they are the two most popular public figures, I would bet\_it would be fewer than the maximum of 10% that the MRS and their allies in the so-called Broad Front for Democracy\_convinced to boycott the election.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before concluding, the MRS communique makes totally unsupportable claims that the “economic and social situation\_in the country is deteriorating more and more every day.” Anyone who reads the briefs that regularly follow this blog\_knows for themselves that that assessment stands in opposition to objective evidence and the statements from the\_most humble farmer to the biggest capitalist and multilateral lender. The MRS has become expert at the Big Lie\_technique that was used so effectively against them when they used to be revolutionaries who helped overthrow a\_dictator and create “a society with opportunities, progress, solidarity, democracy, and sovereignty.” I wish they would\_recover their youthful idealism.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>BRIEFS</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">The Nicaragua government and the Organization of American States (OAS) issued a joint report\_reiterating their commitment to continue to strengthen democracy and to implement steps to ensure free, fair and\_transparent elections. A memorandum of understanding will be signed next month to define the working\_mechanisms to be implemented for the Nicaragua municipal elections in November of this year.\_(Nicaragua\_News, Jan. 23)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Last week a United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DAES) Report ranked Nicaragua\_among the countries of Central America with the highest growth rate projection for this year. The UN report noted\_that Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama are expecting to surpass 4% growth; driven by greater dynamism in\_public-private investments.\_(Nicaragua News, Jan. 23)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">An M&amp;R poll published last Wednesday found that fewer Nicaraguans want to migrate to another country.\_Seventy percent (70%) of respondents said they are not planning to leave the country; and 78% expressed great\_confidence in a better future. The survey was carried out between December 15 and 30 last year and is based on\_interviews with 1,600 individuals nationwide.\_(Nicaragua News, Jan. 20)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">That same M&amp;R poll found that 81.3% of Nicaraguans believe that President Daniel Ortega is leading the\_country along the right path. Seventy eight percent (78%) of respondents said his administration generates hope;\_79.3% believe his government is promoting reconciliation and national unity and 81.9% feel that the country has\_made significant progress in recent years.\_(Nicaragua News, Jan. 19)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Nicaragua Vice President Rosario Murillo announced that more than 15,000 titles to property will be\_delivered to Nicaragua families during the first quarter of this year. The Vice President noted that most of the\_titles will go to female head of households and will help to strengthen legal certainty and property rights in the\_country.\_(Nicaragua News, Jan. 18)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\_</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\_</span></p>"
