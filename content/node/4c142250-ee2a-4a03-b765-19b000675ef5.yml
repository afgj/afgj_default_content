As such, the United States is in a race against time to undermine President Ortega before a tsunami of developing countries wanting success through his model of autonomy topples all its remaining puppet dictatorships.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Historically, the U.S. government justified imperial invasion and occupation by claiming its targeted country was 'communist.' Now that the spurious threat of communism has been largely debunked, the latest buzzword used to justify imperial aggression by the United States, when it's not throwing around the word 'terrorism,' is 'democracy.' In doing this, the United States effectively lowered its justification bar further, because democracy is a nebulous concept at best. The United States conceals its imperialist aggression under the pretense of being\_<a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-united-states-must-be-the-worlds-policeman-1474412665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-united-states-must-be-the-worlds-policeman-1474412665&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537487055753000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBTRRaAZVwERznM7zLISWwTYPGCw\">the world's democracy 'policeman'\_</a>when in fact it is just the opposite. The United States functions as the world's democracy criminal, overthrowing legitimate governments of sovereign nations to allow its puppet master transnational corporations to unabashedly steal without interference.\_</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Accordingly, the word 'democracy' merely provides cover for a pitiful and desperate attack against the rights of sovereign countries, such as Nicaragua and Venezuela, to self-determination and self-defense. Within this context, the word 'democracy' is dead and needs to be buried. Justice is autonomy over subservience!\_</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>As long as President Ortega remains autonomous and just says no to the dictates of the U.S. government, Nicaragua will never be 'democratic' enough for Washington's liking. The United States will always object to Nicaragua and President Ortega's handling of\_national elections, foreign-funded anti-government news media, armed insurgents/mercenaries disguised as protesters,\_and nefarious non-governmental organizations (NGOs) intent on fomenting discontent. It's a no-win situation because democracy is always a vague pretext.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>President Ortega risks retribution when he openly defies U.S. restrictive trade and development prohibitions. In particular, President Ortega has threatened the United States regional pre-eminence with the planned development of a transoceanic canal, and has overturned U.S. hegemony by negotiating trade deals with countries the United States can't control.\_</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The United States' fear of autonomy spreading among successful developing countries is long standing, and it runs deep and dirty. Invasions and occupations by the United States into sovereign Nicaragua are not new and date back to the early 1900s.

As such, it promotes the spread of environmental doomsday scenarios throughout the complicit news media, and it funds opposition groups, protests and thugs. The canal engenders a regional shift in power that is unfavorable to the United States' expressed interests for three primary reasons. First, the transoceanic canal would lessen U.S. influence over Nicaragua, because the canal provides an alternate and independent funding stream to trade and lending – still largely dominated by the United States. Second, the transoceanic canal would allow China to gain strategic geographic access and control over the passage between two oceans. Reportedly, the depth of the canal, at 28 meters, is deep enough for Chinese submarines to quickly and covertly cross between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Third, the transoceanic canal would impinge upon the profitability of the Panama Canal, because it would subject it to competition from a new waterway designed to accommodate today's larger shipping vessels. As an aside, not only does Panama remain a U.S. outpost, but the United States also enjoys a longstanding trade surplus with Panama.
