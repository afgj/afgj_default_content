      value: "<b>Submitted by\_tortilla, 4/15/2020</b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>President Daniel Ortega addresses Nicaragua's people (and a world in crisis)</i></b>\r\n\r\nGood afternoon, Nicaraguan sisters and brothers, Nicaraguan families. First, our Solidarity and our Condolences to all the families who are suffering from the hardships of this pandemic, whose loved ones have died; some who are in serious condition in Intensive care; others in quarantine. All are suffering and in great pain. This is a time that calls for solidarity and unity among the peoples of the World.\r\n\r\nAnd when we call for solidarity and unity as the peoples of the World, it means that we are being called to Peace. That is the first principle: Peace; to put an end to all types of war, to all types of aggression, against any people, and to cultivate Peace, to strengthen Peace. Because only a world at Peace will allow us, particularly the more developed countries, to create the conditions so that on this planet we do not face such dramatic situations as those in developed countries where there is a lack of beds and medical instruments, simply because the health services do not reach the people, do not reach the poor, do not reach the workers. Public services have been totally abandoned.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are great, highly qualified hospitals, with a lot of technology and great scientists. But who can go to pay for services in a private hospital in a developed country or in a developing country? This is what is bleeding, that is, the world's flesh has been ripped open by this pandemic.\r\n\r\nAnd what use are atomic bombs? Are atomic weapons going to end the virus, the missiles that are being developed now in these arms races to conquer space and turn space into a battlefield, for killing, to kill? What are those weapons for? These weapons are not for life, they are not for health; they are not for the feeding of millions of human beings that perish year after year from hunger.\r\n\r\nThese weapons are for killing! And trillions are spent on them! And those who spend those trillions know perfectly well that these weapons cannot be used, because the day they are used, the entire population of the Planet will disappear. They know perfectly well! So why this madness of investing billions and trillions in weapons?\r\n\r\nAnd how many epidemics, how many pandemics has humanity experienced? How many? How many millions of human beings have died in those pandemics, in those epidemics? In the midst of the World Wars, in the First World War, in the Second World War, there were epidemics and pandemics, and in the midst of the epidemics and pandemics there was no ceasefire. They kept killing each other, making war.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that this pandemic, this virus that has multiplied throughout the planet,\_ no force is able to block it; there is no barrier that can block it, there is no wall that can block it. There is no way! There is no billionaire who can block it.\r\n\r\nOf course, peoples in developing countries are the most exposed, the most vulnerable to this pandemic, and we already know how tragedies are repeated every year in developing countries, from the migration from Africa, seeking to reach Europe, during which thousands of adults, women and children die, drowning there in the sea, in that beautiful sea there, from Europe facing Africa, North Africa, and from North Africa they seek a way into Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are those migrants, there they are right now. What can these migrants do in the face of this pandemic, and likewise the migrants here who are also moving northwards, where we see that many of them are kept in cages there. Nicaraguans who have been deported home tell us how they are caged, how they are mistreated, and that there is no health care.\r\n\r\nBut what health care can they give them, if they don't even have the capacity in that country, the world’s greatest superpower, the greatest military power in the history of humanity, the greatest economic power in the history of humanity, which does not have the capacity to meet the needs of its own citizens in its great cities. This is a tragedy that Europe is experiencing too.\r\n\r\nThis is what we can see and it is calling upon us, and it is a call that we can make from this small country, where we are facing the pandemic with our limited resources. With great patience, with great discipline, with great sacrifice on the part of health workers, with a high level of citizen engagement, with a high level of discipline from the workers, with great dedication from the Army, from the Police, protecting security and our territorial integrity; well, we have been fighting the fight.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, from the moment it was decreed on March 11th: Let's see, from March 11th to April 15th, we had 1,237 reported deaths. Of all these, just one was from coronavirus. The other deceased, men, women and children, why did they die? From malignant tumors, diabetes, renal disease, acute myocardial infarction, hypertensive diseases; traffic accidents, cerebrovascular accidents, liver cirrhosis, neonatal asphyxia, congenital malformations, neonatal sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, septicemia. Suicides... yes, suicides! Drownings, yes, by drowning! Deaths from HIV.\r\n\r\nSee how much pain we've had in these families too! So much pain! We are talking about the period from March 11 to April 15, in Nicaragua, 1,237 people died from different causes.\r\n\r\nAnd in the fight to take care of these families of people who arrive injured and need hospital care, in this fight to also bring health to thousands of Nicaraguans, how many medical consultations took place in this period? Thousands of doctor’s visits, thousands of operations, totally free of charge. Thousands of hemodialysis treatments!\r\n\r\nHere the health system has not stopped providing free hemodialysis; that is the public health system. The private one is different, the private one charges, of course. The poor go to the public health system. The workers use it, and families looking for ways to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nHemodialysis! We've been incorporating even more hemodialysis systems; incorporating radiotherapy systems to attack cancer more effectively; inaugurating ICUs in the departmental hospitals and in municipal hospitals. Recently an ICU was inaugurated in Chontales, in Juigalpa.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this pandemic, we have not stopped working, because here if we stop working, the country dies, and if the country dies, the people die, they get wiped out. If rural workers stop planting to harvest beans, if they stop sowing to harvest corn, if they stop planting to harvest coffee, if they stop sowing to ensure the supply of potatoes, carrots, radishes, onions... because, thank God, we are a country that even in the midst of the greatest difficulties, the greatest tragedies, the greatest boycotts, we are a country with working people and thanks be to God with land our people know how to cultivate very well and also know how to raise livestock.\r\n\r\nOur people will not die of hunger! Big investments, big capital, can be affected by all these developments, because there is a supply chain in the field of international trade, in the field of international markets, which is unquestionably impacted and causes unemployment, which is felt here.\r\n\r\nWell, the important thing here is that we have continued working, following guidelines very conscientiously and with great discipline; our people follow the rules the Health System dictates. And this is repeated everywhere, multiplied not only by transmitting these guidelines via the media, but also through house to house visits, giving people leaflets and explaining to families how to protect themselves from this pandemic. That is what helps explain and what does explain why the pandemic has spread so slowly. It's not that it hasn't entered Nicaragua, of course it has entered and has already caused one death, but its progress has been slow; and everyone affected has been as a result of outside contact.\r\n\r\nOver the last few days they arrested a Nicaraguan girl in Costa Rica, a 17-year-old girl, who was pregnant. The Costa Rican authorities arrested her because she was crossing the border illegally. Immediately the media there began reporting that the Nicaraguan girl had Coronavirus. But the Costa Rican authorities, acting with great professionalism, seriousness, and responsibility, examined her and said: She does not have Coronavirus! That is to say, a Nicaraguan woman has not been found carrying the virus from Nicaragua to a sister country.\r\n\r\nBut yes, sister and brother Nicaraguans arriving from other countries, when they come, they are detected; they may not arrive seriously ill, but they are subject to the corresponding procedure [at the airport and borders]. The majority have left the process of care, examination, follow-up, treatment [and have recovered], even some serious cases that seemed to be dying.\r\n\r\nOne of them, a very well-known comrade of ours, lived in the United States, and arrived very, very seriously ill, including from other illnesses he already had. And well, we prayed to God, and he managed to survive the state he was in, thank God, when he seemed about to die. There was another woman who arrived very seriously ill. That is, when the doctors began caring for her, they thought it would be hard for her to survive.\r\n\r\nBut they received care from Nicaraguan doctors, who are highly specialized, highly skilled, not only because they have studied in our country, but also because they studied specialized careers, specializations in other countries, in other sister nations.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, in the Soviet Union, how many doctors studied [medical] specialties? In Mexico, how many doctors have done specializations there! In Venezuela, how many Nicaraguans have received specialized training! And how many specialized doctors from the United States too... in other words, we do have highly specialized doctors.\r\n\r\nAnd as for hospitals? Practically 90% of the hospitals that are in the public health system are equipped with all the basic resources to care for patients to the extent of the bed capacity that these hospitals allow.\r\n\r\nThere are enough respirators. Thank God it has not been necessary to use all the ventilators; some have been used, but not all have been used.\r\n\r\nIntensive Care Units? Yes, we have Intensive Care Units everywhere, with highly specialized doctors.\r\n\r\nThe reserve of medicines in the health system, in the whole public health system, including of course the Social Security system, there we are talking about 90% and sometimes more, and some medicines that only the State has, like Interferon for example.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we have the capacity to care for the population, while the rate at which the epidemic has spread has been one we have managed to control... Yes, we have managed to do so!\r\n\r\nIn other words, we didn't call for a stampede. If we had triggered a stampede, what happens to people in stadiums would have happened to us—we would have been crushed. Instead, in an orderly manner, and guided by\_international standards, we have been adopting a series of measures\_and applying them according to our national reality, our material possibilities, our economic possibilities, our scientific possibilities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the police are also protecting the country's security. Imagine, if we were to send the Police to isolate themselves, or if we sent the Army to isolation, and rural workers to isolate themselves and stop producing, the country would simply disappear. So here it has been a combination of careful measures to be able to deal with this plague.\r\n\r\nThe latest data was given today by Doctor Saenz. He gave the latest data on the cases we currently have. In the region we have the least number of cases.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's also true that we have many hospitals, we have built many hospitals; even the hospitals they burned down in April 2018, we have already rebuilt them; the health posts they burned down that April, we have already rebuilt them. Yes, we have already rebuilt all that! And all the equipment, and medical instruments they destroyed by fire in April, we have already bought and replaced them.\r\n\r\nWe're building roads, we're opening bridges. Yes, for example the Malacatoya Bridge, a historic bridge, just like the highway to San Carlos, after years and years, after centuries waiting for that highway. The Malacatoya Bridge, which is the second largest bridge in Nicaragua, opened in the midst of this situation, and none of the workers have been affected. No cases have been found in the town of Malacatoya.\r\n\r\nSo, the thing now is to continue managing with follow-up, with permanent monitoring. In any case, when patients are found to have signs that could be symptoms of the virus, they are isolated and treated, and once they have passed the isolation period, well, if they are ok then they go home, they get to go back out on the streets.\r\n\r\nI do believe that this is the time for change in the world. This is a sign from God, yes... this is a sign from God, who is telling us: You are going the wrong way, spending trillions on atomic bombs, on atomic weapons, on military bases, on military alliances. It is fine for the army to protect a country's sovereignty and territory and a country's security—that is all right. And the Police, that is fine. But\_those transnational forces now only aspiring to dominate the whole planet; that is a sin!\r\n\r\nAnd God is telling us, the Lord is telling us, the Lord is sending us this sign, and this is our chance to make a change towards Peace. This is the time for those great resources to be used decisively once and for all, the peoples of these countries that are suffering the onslaught of this pandemic, the peoples of the developed countries that are suffering, it is hitting them terribly, they can decide to tell their Governments: No more money for nuclear arms, for sophisticated weaponry. Let us limit weapons to those needed to protect our territory.\r\n\r\nAnd those funds that have already been allocated, amounting to billions and trillions, let them be reallocated to build hospitals for the poor, for the people and for the workers, right in the United States, who so badly need them. They should be given all the medical equipment needed so they are prepared to face situations such as this. Because this is not the first time a pandemic has ravaged the world, but it is the first pandemic to hit this hard. Although pandemics have affected the developed world before, this one is hitting the developed world much harder, and it is hitting international markets, it is hitting stock prices, and it is hitting the world economy.\r\n\r\nSo, it is time to swap nuclear weapons for hospitals, for health posts, for all the basic conditions that can be provided to the peoples of the developed countries, and for them to cooperate so that we in the developing countries can also enjoy that protection.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the best atomic weapon humanity can have is health, medicine, hospitals, preventive medicine, and curative medicine, and for that we need resources, and we know very well who has them, and we know very well how they use them; therefore, now is the time for change.\r\n\r\nAnd it is time to change the United Nations as well, and we have been repeating this for years. The United Nations needs to be totally remodeled, reconverted, reconstituted... It must be re-founded, as Father d'Escoto said when he was President of the United Nations General Assembly. It must be re-founded, and he planted the Nicaraguan flag there, proposing the re-founding of the United Nations, the re-founding of all the instruments of the United Nations, the re-founding of those regional instruments which are also totally discredited, decrepit and worn out.\r\n\r\nThe world demands an ethical and moral re-founding, and that happens because resources need to be placed where they belong, so as to save lives and give security to families, and give true Christian Love to Humanity.\r\n\r\nThank you, Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers.\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Ten Cases Total of COVID-19\r\n</b>Thirty-three days after registering its first case of Covid-19 on March 18, there have been a total of ten cases of Covid-19, of which seven recovered, two died and one is under treatment. Nicaragua continues to have the lowest contagion rate of Covid-19 in all of the Americas. The latest Health Ministry report reveals that a 58-year-old man who came into contact with an imported case is patient number 10, and is in poor health. There are currently 12 people who had contact with one of the cases and who tested negative but are being closely followed. (Radiolaprimerisima, 4/21/20)\r\n\r\n<b>Presidential Address on Nicaragua and Covid-19\r\n</b>During a national address delivered on April 16, President Daniel Ortega stated that Nicaragua is facing the coronavirus pandemic applying measures established by the World Health Organization taking into account the realities of the country. “Since January of this year, when the WHO issued its alert on the spread of coronavirus, Nicaragua began to prepare by training doctors in the handling of the virus, establishing preventive information campaigns, border control, equipping 19 hospitals for the care of cases, acquiring reagents to diagnose cases and mobilizing medical brigades to disseminate preventive information house to house and monitor the health of Nicaraguans.\" The President also stressed that \"the country has been able to continue working and producing to guarantee food security for the population, relying on the discipline and responsibility of Nicaraguans to follow the measures announced by the Ministry of Health. This does not mean that we are exempt from the effects of the virus, it is a reality that it has entered the country with 9 cases already detected of which one person has died, however, the spread has been slow and so far, we do not have local transmission, this is due to the protocols for early detection, contact tracing, monitoring and the responsibility of the population.” (Nicaragua News, 4/16/20)\r\n\r\n<b>Daniel Corners Social Networks with Hospitals vs. Bombs Speech\r\n</b>In a matter of a few hours, President Daniel Ortega became the greatest influence in the country's recent history by dominating social networks without having an official account in any of them. Companies that measure the traffic and interaction on the networks said that from late afternoon of April 15 until the morning of April 16, 34 million people had seen Daniel’s 32-minute speech calling on the world to invest in hospitals not nuclear bombs. Even the opposition media on social networks transmitted the presidential message on their platforms and it was reported by FOX, CNN, Univision, Bloomberg, TELESUR, BBC, all the international news agencies and all the main media of the Americas including The Washington Post and New York Times, El País from Spain; among others.

Tedros added that the pandemic has forced children out of school, \"putting some at greater risk of abuse,\" and depriving children from attending schools that are often their main access to food and health care.
