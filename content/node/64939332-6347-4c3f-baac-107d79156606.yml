There are many families with children participating in the march and whose health and lives are at risk. The march was called by COPINH to demand justice for its assassinated General Coordinator Berta Caceres, an independent international commission to investigate her assassination, and the immediate cancellation of the concession granted to the DESA corporation to develop the Agua Zarca dam in Rio Blanco, along with all other mining and hydroelectric concessions on Lenca indigenous territory.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_H-Br2KwuIc\" width=\"427\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\nPlease call:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa at (504) 2236-9320 and ask for the ambassador or his assistant Annie-Marie Lancu or Human Rights officer Jason Smith.
