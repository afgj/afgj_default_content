How have groups been repressed and incarcerated for their political beliefs/activities and what can we do to stop it? The dimensions of political repression will be discussed focusing on change over time in context of 1) how activists have responded to repression 2) how the government has responded to civic engagement and activism by developing new state apparatus and 3) how non-governmental/corporate entities have inﬂuenced decision making and programs for criminalizing dissent.\r\n\r\nThe ﬁrst unit of the course will focus on the how and why people have been historically and contemporarily incarcerated for their political beliefs. We will focus on analyzing the prison industrial complex and the history of movements that have been targeted in the past such as the legacy of the FBI’s programs in the early 1900’s to J Edger Hoovers led counter-intelligence\r\nprograms that attacked groups in the 60s and 70s. The second unit will focus on more recent events dating from the Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization in 1999, the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century Post-911 to todays new laws such as the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and realities of reﬁned tactics of repression such as the most recent law for detaining citizens.

He is also active in student organizing with various NW student groups, food-sharing programs such as Food Not Bombs and Homeless advocacy. Moreover he works with local Portland coalitions around issues related to political repression, anti-corporatism and climate change. He currently organizes with Occupy Portland's N17 spokes council (Portland Action Lab) where he was arrested with his afﬁnity group for shutting down a Wells Fargo in November 2011 while engaging in non-violent civil disobedience. Moreover he is the co-founder of the Law &amp; Disorder Conference, an annual event that focuses on anti-oppression work. He is currently a doctoral student in the department of history at Washington State University Vancouver focusing on African cultural retentions and memory systems of the African Diaspora in the Americas during the time of enslavement. His historical analysis of trans-Atlantic linkages between Africa and the Americas primarily looks at cultural expressions in folklore, art, music, drumming and dance, resistance and religion. He received his MA in Pan African Studies at Syracuse University in 2007. His thesis about the Saramaka people of Suriname, South America revealed how, in the quest for freedom, many enslaved Africans ﬂed from the plantations into the Surinamese rain forest where they set up independent communities.\r\n\r\nHe is interested in how neoliberal globalization, socio-economic and political changes impact human memory. His intention is to contribute to this area of historical scholarship by providing trans-Atlantic thematic approaches that will enhance our understanding of the era of the slave trade and the tremendous impact it has on the world today.
