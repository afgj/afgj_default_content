One of these was CENIDH, run by Vilma Nuñez.

Although there is nothing on its website to indicate where this money comes from, as was also the case with CENIDH, its Facebook page suggests it gets support from the UK embassy in Costa Rica and other sources. Nicaragua Nunca Más enjoys the collaboration of the Costa Rican government, which regularly condemns Nicaragua despite having its own considerable human rights issues.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nunca Más was only set up in February but already it is having a considerable influence on international bodies. So far its most successful campaign has been against the ‘assassination’ of campesinos in rural areas of Nicaragua, allegedly by the Nicaraguan army or police, and supposedly focused on people who opposed the government during the protests in 2018. All of the key international bodies have treated this seriously. The OAS\_</span><a href=\"http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/audiencias/Hearings.aspx?Lang=es&amp;Session=1165\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took evidence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_about it from Nunca Más on September 25, and on October 4 the IACHR issued a\_</span><a href=\"https://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2019/248.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, denouncing the killing of ‘at least 30’ campesinos, the majority linked with the opposition or in political conflict with the government. In addition Andrew Gilmour, the (British) Assistant Secretary-General for human rights at the UN,\_</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilmourun?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">travelled to Costa Rica</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_to hear the allegations of ‘terrible repression’ from Nunca Más, and Gilmour also listened sympathetically to the similar views of the\_</span><a href=\"https://www.elpais.cr/2019/10/08/costa-rica-gestiona-apoyo-para-candidatura-a-consejo-de-derechos-humanos-de-naciones-unidas/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costa Rican government</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its campaign for international sanctions against Nicaragua, the opposition Civic Alliance has just presented the OEA with one of the glossy reports produced by Nicaragua Nunca Más. Entitled\_</span><a href=\"https://issuu.com/colectivodhnicaragua/docs/informe_nic_2019-09-25pm/70\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Situación de Derechos Humanos de la Población Campesina</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_(‘Human rights situation of the rural population’) it accuses the government of\_</span><a href=\"https://www.despacho505.com/represion-del-regimen-contra-campesinos-ha-sido-sistematica-selectiva-y-letal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">systematic, selective and lethal repression</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_of campesinos (peasants), with 30 of the deaths allegedly occurring in the first nine months of this year.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a report which supposedly gives details of a campaign of terror in the countryside, it has an unusual structure. The first part is not about the present day at all, but deals with the protests against the interoceanic canal in the years leading up to 2017. Despite the allegations of repression, the anti-canal movement was able to hold around 80 large demonstrations in this period, and no one was killed (although there were clashes with police when protesters set up road blocks, which led to injuries on both sides).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second part is about the roadblocks set up in rural areas during the failed coup attempt in 2018. But the report says nothing of the deaths which occurred in the roadblocks, for example the many people killed when they tried to pass them, or who died on the way to receive urgent treatment because ambulances were prevented from reaching the hospital in time. The report by solidarity activists,\_</span><a href=\"https://afgj.org/dismissing-the-truth-why-amnesty-international-is-wrong-about-nicaragua\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dismissing the Truth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, devotes a chapter (Chapter 5) to the deaths that occurred in Central Nicaragua in the first half of last year, showing that most of the victims were indeed local people, but killed not by police but by those controlling the roadblocks.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third section of the Nunca Más report is about the arrest and trial of Medardo Mairena and Pedro Mena, men who were found guilty of organising the massacre in the small town of Morrito. The act of terror they led is barely mentioned, and it is stated inaccurately that two people died when the actual death toll was five, of whom four were police and one was a popular local teacher.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full story was\_</span><a href=\"http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/5657\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">told in January</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_by Dick y Miriam Emanuelsson. The Whatsapp messages on the phones carried by Mairena and Mena when they were arrested, and testimony of people who heard the plans being made, provided the evidence that led to their conviction. Nevertheless they were released in the government’s conditional amnesty in June, and Mairena is now touting himself as a potential presidential candidate.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth section is about displacement of campesinos who fled to Costa Rica when the roadblocks were dismantled. Hardly any people involved are mentioned by name, but in any case the report completely fails to point out that many of those who fled the roadblocks did so because they were guilty of crimes and were carrying weapons. Instead, it portrays them all as innocent victims of government persecution.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only in the fifth section of the report are there details of 'executions' in rural areas, and most of these relate to the period 2008-2017, well before the recent protests began. The 2019 cases, supposedly a consequence of last year’s protests, take up only nine pages of the report. Of the '30' deaths, only seven are presented with any details. Most of these relate to members of one family, of which two deaths occurred in Honduras. In one of the seven cases, only the first name of the victim (‘Martin’) is given, making it impossible to verify the account.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real stories behind several of the earlier and recent cases have been examined by the independent news agency\_</span><a href=\"https://cartabodan.net/2019/10/18/intentan-confundir-muertes-en-el-campo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carta Boden</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which often prints news stories favourable to the opposition as well as reporting government news. For example, the murders that occurred in Honduras, 25km distant from the frontier with Nicaragua, were attributed by the local police and press to family enemies, with no evidence of any involvement by the Nicaraguan authorities. In total, including cases dating back to 2008, Carta Boden says that the report claims that there have been 55 rural assassinations, but gives details only of 26 of these, and makes a clear link with the Nicaraguan army or police in only 18 cases. Even for these, the analysis shows that many were related to ordinary crimes such as drug trafficking, cattle rustling or murder. Carta Boden concluded that the deaths it investigated had nothing to do with the political situation.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, Nicaragua Nunca Más has written a report claiming that the Nicaraguan government is carrying out a campaign of terror in rural areas, which contains little or no hard evidence that this is happening at all. Even where deaths or other incidents are documented, the report very often fails to explain the context which would enable the incidents to be properly understood. Of course, the opposition know that if they present a glossy, well designed 80-page report, the majority of the media who are sympathetic to their politics will produce headlines such as\_</span><a href=\"https://www.despacho505.com/represion-del-regimen-contra-campesinos-ha-sido-sistematica-selectiva-y-letal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regime’s Repression against Campesinos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should be more surprising, but sadly isn’t, is the uncritical gullibility of the international organisations when they receive this material and their failure to do due diligence in checking the facts. Presumably, Nicaragua Nunca Más knows that administrators at the UN, OAS and IACHR are unlikely to do more than glance through a report of this kind and will take it at face value. Even if they look at the detail, they will have no knowledge of the local circumstances. For the opposition and their propagandists in ‘human rights’ organisations, the key aim is to give the impression that (as the report puts it) the rural areas of Nicaragua are suffering under a government-led 'wave of crime' directed against people who formed part of the opposition last year. The fact that few people in Nicaragua have observed this crime wave is totally irrelevant since the report’s overriding purpose is to offer false pretexts for unjust international condemnation of Nicaragua’s Sandinista government.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Millions of Dollars Provided In Loans to Nearly 400,000 Women\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the director of the microloan program called “Zero Usury,” Leonor Corea, reported that in the last 12 years financing totaling US$23.9 million has been provided to more than 380,000 women in 140 municipalities throughout the country to establish and expand small businesses. Corea said that \"In 2019 financing has been provided to 15,000 women which reflects the Program´s contribution to the revitalization of the national economy.\" (Nicaragua News, 10/28/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Putin Awards Order of Friendship to Vice President Rosario Murillo\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo the Order of Friendship on October 28 for her contribution to friendship and cooperation. The decree published on Monday was signed by Putin on October 26. Nicaragua established diplomatic relations with the former Soviet Union on October 18, 1979, shortly after the triumph of the popular revolution by the Sandinista National Liberation Front that returned to power in 2007.

Báez claimed credit for organizing the opposition group known as “the Civic Alliance” and was recorded saying he would like to see President Ortega put in front of a firing squad. \"It is not enough to pray,\" said Rafael and Tomás Valdés of the Christian community of San Pablo Apóstol church in the 14 de Septiembre neighborhood.” They and their fellow parishioners gathered almost 600,000 signatures requesting that the Pope remove Báez from the country, a petition fulfilled by the Pope soon afterward. (Radiolaprimerisima, 10/26/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Cordoba Stronger Against the Dollar\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Central Bank of Nicaragua decided on October 28 to set the rate of devaluation of the Cordoba against the U.S. dollar at 3 percent annually, which is a reduction of 2% compared to the prevailing rate of devaluation of 5 percent. This rate will begin to be applied and published in the monthly exchange rate table as of November 1, 2019. The bank said in a press release, \"This decision is adopted in the context of an adequate macroeconomic policy framework and adequate indicators, which include: balance in public finances; surplus in the current account of the balance of payments, adequate level and coverage of international reserves; and stability in the financial system.\" The Bank added that reducing the devaluation will help stabilize aggregate spending for the national economy by reducing costs and improving the purchasing power of wages. (Radiolaprimerisima, Informe Pastran 10/28/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua Leads Central America in Livestock and Exports\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicaragua's livestock sector has had a good year, not only in the expansion the raising of livestock, but also in the export of beef. FSLN Deputy and cattle producer Douglas Aleman called Nicaragua “the king of meat in Central America. Thirteen thousand families operate 164,000 farms and ranches with an official census of 5.57 million head of cattle and 650,000 direct jobs. Aleman observed, \"…we have a production of 5 million liters of milk per day. Currently 75% of production is destined for export.” He said that \"the fact that we are recognized as the country with the largest herd in the region, with the best quality meat, highest exports is because we have a national strategy for the development of the sector. There is a vision, a State policy, government support with better infrastructure such as roads, electrification, drinking water, telecommunications, sanitary controls, bovine traceability, IPSA support; all this helps production and therefore marketing, which together with the effort of producers and the effort of the meat industry have given us this impetus.” According to the Center for Export Procedures (CETREX), in the first nine months of 2019 Nicaragua exported 87,744 tons of beef, generating US$362 million, second in exports to green coffee. Beef is followed by sugar, peanuts, beans, farmed shrimp, lobsters, fresh cheese, fish, and tobacco, among others.
