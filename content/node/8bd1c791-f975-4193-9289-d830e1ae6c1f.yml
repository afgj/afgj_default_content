We will hear about the relation between the “War on Drugs” and the police and prison industrial complex on both sides of the border. The next day we’ll see examples of border militarization before crossing into Sonora. We will then go to Cananea and visit striking miners and community members affected by Grupo Mexico’s 10.5 million gallon sulfuric acid spill, the largest environmental disaster in the Mexico's history. We’ll travel to Hermosillo and meet Yaqui activists struggling for their water rights. And we'll get together with members of the labor and popular movement. We also hope to visit the US funded federal prison in Hermosillo, the first privately managed, for-profit prison in Mexico. Throughout the delegation, wherever we go, we will meet with family members and defenders of current political prisoners, as well as ex-political prisoners.\r\n\r\nFrom Hermosillo, we will travel to Oaxaca, where we will meet with leaders of the\_ teachers union, popular and student movement organizers and indigenous activists. We will travel to a Mixtec village and learn how their community is being affected by free trade and corporate encroachment. We will also take some tourist time to visit the Monte Alban ruins.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>To Register Email:\_<a href=\"mailto:Delegations@afgj.org\">Delegations@afgj.org</a></strong></h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_6877\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-6877 size-medium\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160517_115620-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160517_115620\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /> A visit to Monte Alban![/caption]\r\n\r\nWe’ll finish the delegation in Mexico City. There we will visit with labor leaders, human rights activists, ex-political prisoners, activists against torture, and we’ll have in depth discussions with experts on police militarization and the Mexican prison system.\_ Our last full day, we will attend the mass gathering on November 20 in Mexico City for the <a href=\"http://www.defensamadretierra.mx/nuevo/\"><strong>We Defend Mother Earth Campaign</strong></a>.

This includes all meals, housing (double occupancy), all transportation except your initial flight to Tucson and home from Mexico City, airport pick-up and delivery, translation and program expenses.
