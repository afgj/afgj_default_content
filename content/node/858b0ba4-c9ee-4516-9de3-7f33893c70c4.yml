      value: "<b><b>January 6-15, 2017</b></b>\r\n\r\nAfGJ Board Member John Ocampo will lead this first-time AfGJ delegation to Paraguay, a little-known country to US solidarity activists, students, and Latin American Studies departments. Paraguay has the most unequal land distribution in the hemisphere and its agro-export model leaves little land to grow food for its own people. Learn with AfGJ about struggles by popular organizations for economic equality and food sovereignty. Price: TBZ\r\n\r\n<strong>For an more information, or to be notified when regisration opens, contact: <a href=\"mailto:Delegations@afgj.org\">Delegations@afgj.org</a></strong>"
