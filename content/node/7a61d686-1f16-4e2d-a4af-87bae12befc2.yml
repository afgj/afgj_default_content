As 2020 approaches President Maduro, the ultimate survival artist of our generation, is bound to confront a new set of challenges.

Díaz-Canel highlighted accomplishments in 2019, among them: the building of 43,700 new housing units, 80 new railroad cars, and 300 new buses—assembled in Cuba. He mentioned salary increases for workers, expanded telephone service and internet access, and 3,855 new hotel rooms for tourists.
