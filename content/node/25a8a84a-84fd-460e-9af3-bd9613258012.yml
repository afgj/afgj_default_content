The first is the “war on drugs,” the second is what is actually happening in Nicaragua to fight narcotrafficking, and the third is the US’s ongoing,\_inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.\n\nFor several consecutive administrations, the US has defined “the war on drugs” as a war on supply to be fought outside of our borders. <a href=\"https://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/war-on-drugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Despite spending billions of dollars with nothing to\_show for it</a>\_, the US has clung stubbornly to this approach. We have ignored the consensus in much of the rest of the\_world that the problem is one of appetite. As long as people in the US are willing to spend billions of dollars on illegal drugs to get high, someone somewhere will supply the product. Many\_sovereign countries in Latin America and elsewhere have taken the very reasonable position that the US’s consumption of illegal drugs is not their problem and it is not a priority for them to\_help solve it, especially not on their soil.\n\nNicaragua has only to look to its neighbors to the north, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, countries allied with and heavily financed by the US’s war on drugs to see how bad things\_can go. The northern triangle countries are among the most violent and corrupt in the world. They are near failed states where many aspects of government barely function. In comparison,\_Nicaragua is safe, stable, and peaceful.\n\nNone-the-less, Nicaragua is quite active in working to prevent the damage that could be caused by the transportation of drugs through the country, particularly preventing the violence and\_corruption associated with gangs and drug cartels. This is acknowledged by the Nicaragua country report within the 2016 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report: Nicaragua’s\_“‘Retaining Wall’\_(Muro de Contención) strategy promotes a coordinated effort to stop narcotics traffickers from entering the country.” (For a good description of this strategy see <a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:21042-estrategia-muro-de-contencion-ha-dado-excelentes-resultados\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article</a>) The Strategy Report goes on to detail many anti-trafficking activities,\_including drug seizures carried out in cooperation with the US and other international partners. \_The concluding statement about “institutional corruption” feels tacked on and not supported\_by what has come before.\n\nThe tone of the conclusion of the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report is paternal and condescending. It assumes that, of course, the US can grade and prescribe what other\_countries do: “The Government of Nicaragua must increase efforts to combat organized crime within the vulnerable Caribbean coast regions of Nicaragua, which remain the primary routes\_for international drug trafficking. In addition, an increased focus on drug prevention programs and rehabilitation facilities, institutional corruption, and judicial independence is recommended\_to complement interdiction efforts.” <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2016/vol1/253295.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(US dept of state resource)</a> This is a continuation of a long, despicable history in which the US has tried to control and\_dictate to Nicaraguans how their country should be run. Nicaraguans are completely capable of analyzing their own situation and deciding what, if anything, they want to do about it. The US\_has no standing to tell them what they “must”\_do.\n\nThe government of Nicaragua is not perfect. We know this because no government in the world is, including our own. However, sovereign nations, which like Nicaragua, are not a threat to\_anyone, have a right to struggle with their own imperfections and to work them out in their own way.\n\nThe article\_in\_La Prensa, includes commentary by\_sociologist and political analyst Oscar René\_Vargas. He says the report means that the United States \"is following the political, economic\_and social events of Nicaragua… that Nicaragua is already on the radar of the United States.\_This does not mean that the United States will take immediate action against the government,\_but it does mean that the promoters of the 'Nica Act' will take into account… the State Department report.” (The NICA Act would cut Nicaragua off from the system of international loans that\_Global South countries need to run themselves in the global neoliberal economic system. See:<a href=\"https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/legislation/h-r-5708-nicaragua-investment-conditionality-act-nica-2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this </a>\_for the ridiculous details.\_Those of us who work to keep the US’s relationship with Nicaragua friendly and non-imperialistic need to stay alert to this situation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nBRIEFS\n<ul>\n \t<li>During a meeting in Managua with Directors of Police Academies from Central America, Colombia and the Caribbean, the Inspector General of the Mexican Police Academy,\_Rubén Rodríguez, said Nicaragua is one of the most successful countries in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime. \"We believe this is a very important meeting to learn\_about the Nicaragua experience in public safety, fight against drug trafficking and organized crime,\" the Director of the Mexican Police Academy said. (Nicaragua News, May 1)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) introduced the NICA Act in the Senate. The NICA Act, which was previously introduced in the House by Ileana Ros-Lehtenin, would use the US’s virtual\_veto power to cut off international loans to Nicaragua until the US Secretary of State certifies that the Nicaraguan government has taken steps to guarantee free and fair elections and to\_combat corruption. OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, who has signed an agreement with President Daniel Ortega for the OAS to accompany this year’s municipal elections, said that\_the OAS is “worried” about the effect the NICA Act would have on the Nicaraguan economy. (El Nuevo Diario, Apr. 28)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected continued high growth for Nicaragua’s economy but identified three potential danger areas, one being the effect on private\_investment if the NICA Act becomes law in the US. The other dangers concernforeign aid from Venezuela which dropped from US$600 million in 2015 to $100 million in 2016, and the\_growing deficit in the Social Security Fund (El Nuevo Diario, May 2)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>President Daniel Ortega announced that investment in the fight against poverty and in social sectors will be strengthened during the next four years. He added that these\_investments include the construction of 100,000 units of low-cost housing, water and sanitation systems for 560,000 people, greater funding for health and education, as well as the granting\_of 112,000 property titles. (Nicaragua News, May 1)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>The Minister of Finance and Public Credit Iván Acosta announced that the World Bank will increase its aid to Nicaragua during the next 2 years. \"The amount of the World Bank\_cooperation is projected to increase from US$300 million to US$400 million during the 2018-2020 period. This is an important recognition for the good management of resources and\_successful economic performance achieved in Nicaragua over the last few years,\" Acosta said. [This is the type of aid that would be cut-off if right-wing legislators succeed in passing the\_NICA Act in the US Congress.] (Nicaragua News, May 1)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>The Nicaragua government announced a new investment plan to improve electricity coverage and to install more efficient lighting throughout the country. \"Between 2012 and 2016,\_more than 720,000 incandescent light bulbs were replaced with efficient lighting units. During the next four years, the goal is to install 1, 420,000 efficient lighting units nationwide,\" the\_report said.
