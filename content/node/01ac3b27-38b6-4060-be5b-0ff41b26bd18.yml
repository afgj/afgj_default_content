Nicaragua has so far been among the most successful countries in Latin America in protecting its population from the virus while also maintaining normal economic life. As of March 28th, Nicaragua has three confirmed cases with one fatality. Another 14 people who may have the virus are under observation but have so far tested negative.</i>\r\n\r\nNicaragua's public health system offers free, universal health services based on community-focused preventative care. The national network of hospitals, health centers and health posts is supported by a network of tens of thousands of volunteer health promoters called\_<i>brigadistas</i>. Over the last week, health personnel and\_<i>brigadistas</i>\_have visited over 1.2 million households in an education and monitoring campaign to address the pandemic.\r\n\r\nSince the country is still in the first phase of the pandemic, the government has prioritized prevention and education. Its borders remain open, as do the country's schools and public offices. Public events have not been canceled. Business, travel and trade activities continue without restrictions. Ever since January, when the World Health Organization declared a health emergency in relation to the COVID-19 virus, Nicaragua's government team has coordinated closely with the Panamerican Health Organization, following the relevant protocols for the different phases of the pandemic.\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:99504-nicaragua-y-la-oms-intensifican-medidas-sanitarias-ante-coronavirus-en-el-mundo\">Nicaragua's authorities have promoted</a>\_an intense education campaign aimed at preventing the spread of the virus. The principal measures the government has stressed during the current first phase of the pandemic in Nicaragua have been the importance of thorough hand washing for at least 20 seconds with soap and water and taking care when sneezing or coughing so as not to infect other people.\r\n\r\nTravelers arriving from countries where the virus is active are told to self-isolate for 14 days with follow up from health personnel to check how they are. Other measures frequently promoted every day via radio, television, social networks, posters and printed materials have been: cleaning constantly-used surfaces like desks, phones and computers, work surfaces and toys; keeping a physical distance of at least 1.5 meters when talking with other people; and, most importantly, reporting to the nearest health unit at signs of possible symptoms of the virus. Once the second phase of the pandemic begins, requiring measures of containment, then the government may well ban public events, close schools, enforce social distancing, limit travel and seek to maximize work from home.\r\n\r\nLikewise, in any third phase involving potential uncontrolled spread of the virus among the population, more extreme measures may be taken such as the general quarantine already applied in countries like Venezuela or Argentina. The government has prepared the public health system and the National System of Disaster Prevention's (SINAPRED) civil defense system along with the country's armed forces for that eventuality. At a regional level, Nicaragua has coordinated closely with the mechanisms of the Central American Integration System (SICA) and the system's member governments. SICA has produced a\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/app/webroot/tinymce/source/2020%20(2)/MARZO%202020/26MARZO/plan.pdf\">regional contingency plan</a>\_aiming to protect people from the pandemic and treat those affected while maintaining regional economic life and security.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12623\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-12623\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-300x182.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" /> Photo: Jairo Cajina/Canal 4[/caption]\r\n\r\nNicaragua is one of the few countries in the region with a\_<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_IAFAykeffg\">laboratory of molecular biology</a>\_approved by the World Health Organization. Its director has said it is the only laboratory in the region that produces the reactive agents for the serological diagnosis of dengue and was the only molecular biology laboratory in Latin America able to diagnose influenza types accurately in 2019. Similarly, Nicaragua has the only\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:48072-nicaragua-y-rusia-inauguran-planta-latinoamericana-de-biotecnologia-mechnikov\">public sector plant in Central\_America producing vaccines</a>. The plant is a joint venture between the Nicaraguan government and the Russian Federation and is\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:101449-planta-de-vacunas-en-nicaragua-podria-producir-interferon-alfa-2b\">preparing to produce the Cuban Interferon Alfa-2-B</a>\_antiviral medicine for use treating patients with the COVID-19 virus. On March 18th, the “Henry Reeve”\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:101411-llega-a-nicaragua-brigada-de-medicos-cubanos-henry-reeve\">Cuban medical brigade arrived\_</a>in the country, composed of epidemiologists, virologists, intensive care specialists and other expert medical professionals to strengthen Nicaragua's response to the pandemic. Nicaragua has also participated in\_<a href=\"https://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?o=rn&amp;id=352354&amp;SEO=nicaragua-participa-en-videoconferencia-de-la-aec-sobre-covid-19\">regional video conferences</a>\_facilitated by the Association of Caribbean States, in video conferences with experts from China and has also benefited from\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:101152-republica-de-china-taiwan-comparte-con-nicaragua-exitosa-experiencia-de-contencion-del-coronavirus\">the experiences of experts from Taiwan</a>.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, Nicaragua has been successful preventing the virus from spreading. The authorities have prepared 19 hospitals should the pandemic begin to spread in the general population. 37,206 health workers in both public and private health institutions have been trained in preventive measures, how to identify suspected cases, how to protect fellow health workers, how to provide medical care and how to transfer patients safely between local health units, health centers and hospitals. Similarly, the health ministry has trained 250,000 community health promoters in preventive measures, early identification of patients with symptoms and how to ensure referral of suspected cases to the different health posts, health centers and hospitals.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-12624\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image3-252x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua,\_<a href=\"http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/7155\">the popular economy</a>\_of medium, small and\_micro businesses of all kinds, small farming households and cooperatives across many different industries generate\_70% of all employment. The remainder is provided by the public sector along with the private business sector including free trade zone businesses. This economic structure means that a majority of the economically active population depend on daily or weekly income to be able to buy food and other basic items. So for Nicaragua, as for so many other countries impoverished by centuries of rich-country depredation, this makes shutting down the economy practically impossible.\r\n\r\nFor their part, Nicaragua's right-wing opposition continue the same relentless disinformation campaigns that they used during their violent, failed coup attempt in 2018, spreading false rumors and scaremongering via their news outlets and social media. At times, this propaganda reaches\_<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NEHmu_sOw5A\">extreme levels of malevolent hysteria</a>, claiming the government is concealing hundreds of cases of the virus. In interviews, international media uncritically retail the views of inveterate frauds like\_<a href=\"https://www.univision.com/univision-news/latin-america/nicaraguan-government-ignores-coronavirus-and-prepares-for-large-easter-celebrations-without-church\">Confidencial's Carlos Fernando Chamorro</a>\_accusing Nicaragua's President Ortega of not doing enough to address the pandemic. Opposition propagandists like Chamorro lurch insanely from demented accusations of savage dictatorship to phony complaints of laissez faire negligence.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua, as everywhere else in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the unremitting global class war of elites against the impoverished majority. As in the violent, failed 2018 coup attempt, responses in Nicaragua to the crisis generally reflect that class reality. While the country's right wing opposition elite and their middle class followers dilute their rum and cokes with tears of self-pity, Nicaragua's salt-of-the-earth workers and rural farming families are once again pulling the economy through hard times. Nicaragua's Sandinista government's so far successful measures against the pandemic, as in Cuba and Venezuela despite vicious US sanctions, confirm the superiority of revolutionary grass roots democracy over the all too apparent failures of Western neoliberal plutocracies.\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rigorous Prevention Measures at Border Posts\r\n</b>Vice President Rosario Murillo announced on March 28th that all precautionary and preventive measures are being maintained and applied at all entry points in Nicaragua, at airports and at the borders where regional trade circulates.

Tests continue to be carried out on people who merit it. All of them have come out negative.” The Penitentiary System and the National Police's preventive prisons report shows measures are being applied, all is normal and that visits are taking place. (Radiolaprimerisima, 3/28/20)\r\n\r\n<b>PAHO Reiterates Support\r\n</b>The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reiterated its support for Nicaragua and technical cooperation to combat Covid-19. \"We reiterate to Nicaragua our support and technical cooperation to continue working, to continue supporting public health issues and to continue accompanying the preparation for the response to this health emergency of international importance,\" said Ana Solis Treasure, PAHO/WHO representative.\r\n\r\nDuring a press conference the night of March 26, she reported \"The Pan American Health Organization recognizes that there was an involuntary error in the digitization of one of the instruments it uses for reporting officially confirmed cases in Nicaragua.” It was brought to their attention earlier that day that their website said that Nicaragua had 6 cases, when it actually had 2 cases. “The maps published on our website now show the confirmed cases with the correct data,\" said the PAHO representative. \"We reiterate that for Nicaragua so far there are only two confirmed cases. We apologize to the people of Nicaragua and their government for the concern this error may have caused,\" she said. \"This error will be quickly corrected and we will ensure that it is not repeated.” Solís was accompanied by Health Minister Dr. Carolina Dávila, and Health Ministry Secretary General Dr. Carlos Sáenz, who accepted the apologies offered by PAHO on behalf of the Government of Nicaragua. \"We ask PAHO/WHO to be more careful in the security and safeguarding of the data issued by the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of the Republic of Nicaragua,\" Saenz said. (Radiolaprimerisima, 3/27/20)\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua Helps Develop Central America Plan\r\n</b>The Contingency Plan for a united response to the coronavirus of the Central American Integration System (SICA) was approved March 26. With SICA, the Central American governments will promote plans to tackle the coronavirus in three major components: health and risk management; trade and finance; security, justice and migration.
