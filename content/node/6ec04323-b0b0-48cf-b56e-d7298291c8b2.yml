With little hope of electoral success and its base more divided than ever, it has resorted to spreading mountains of fake news, printing demonstrably false information in hopes of stirring up a frenzy among the population.\r\n\r\nWhile the fear-mongering has spread panic among Nicaragua’s middle and upper classes, the majority of the country’s population has continued to follow government recommendations.\r\n\r\nContrary to claims by the billionaire Jeff Bezos-owned\_<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-nicaragua-daniel-ortega-missing/2020/04/11/3ad1fafc-79c3-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\">Washington Post</a>\_that “Nicaragua declines to confront a pandemic,” the government is pursuing a strategy that parallels the approach of Sweden, and with more success so far.\r\n\r\nI have spent most of 2020 living and reporting in the capital, Managua, so I have seen how international corporate media outlets are spreading misleading claims about Nicaragua and its response to Covid-19, fueling the opposition’s efforts to stir chaos.\r\n\r\nAs of the date of publication, there are\_<a href=\"https://www.canal4.com.ni/index.php/multinoticias/53572-minsa-reitera-no-existen-casos-transmision-comunitaria-covid-19-nicaragua\">no known cases</a>\_of local transmission. All nine patients that have been recorded are Nicaraguans who contracted the virus in the United States, Colombia, or Panama, and brought it back to the country. Five of the nine recuperated, and one, with a preexisting condition, died.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has also benefited from help from its friends and allies. Medical experts from Cuba, some of the best in the entire world, have come to Nicaragua to help combat the pandemic. Nicaraguan health officials have also consulted with experts from both the\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:101645-nicaragua-participa-en-videoconferencia-sobre-covid-19-con-expertos-de-la-republica-popular-china\">People’s Republic of China</a>\_and\_<a href=\"https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:101986-taiwan-dona-un-millon-de-dolares-a-nicaragua-para-el-combate-contra-el-coronavirus\">Taiwan</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua’s economic dilemma, with US coup attempt and informal economy</b>\r\n\r\nWhile Nicaragua’s response to the pandemic has been more hands-off than the lockdown approach pursued by countries in the Global North, it does not mean the government is not taking Covid-19 seriously. Each morning, for example, the Health Ministry (MINSA) holds a press conference featuring officials and health experts updating the public with the latest news on the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nBut unlike the citizens of wealthy, industrialized nations in the Global North, many Nicaraguans face a serious economic dilemma as the pandemic bears down on them.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has only just begun to recover from the enormous economic damage it weathered in a 2018 US-backed coup attempt.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 2020, Nicaragua seemed like it was on the verge of recovering economically from the chaos. Then came Covid-19.\r\n\r\nMore than 70 percent of Nicaraguans work in the informal economic sector, meaning they live hand to mouth, without paychecks or salaries. They grow food, sell products in the street, or provide services, often in their own homes, where they have set up businesses. Nicaragua’s Sandinista government prides itself on enacting an economic model that centers small businesses and informal vendors, providing them with loans at zero interest and other forms of free assistance.\r\n\r\nLarge corporations are present in Nicaragua (Walmart runs some supermarket chains), but it is mostly the middle class and the rich who shop at these stores. The vast majority of working-class Nicaraguans shop in community markets, small businesses, and the informal economy; they buy food, clothes, cleaning supplies, and even electronics from vendors in the streets.\r\n\r\nIf the majority of Nicaraguans who work in these small businesses do not work, they do not eat. And they can’t just get checks from the government, because most of them do not even have bank accounts.\r\n\r\nSo the Sandinista government has responded with a more measured economic response to the crisis. The Nicaraguan economy has not been entirely shut down. Many unnecessary stores and restaurants are closed, but some remain open.\r\n\r\nIn supermarkets, banks, and most stores in Managua, a guard can usually be found in the entrance with a mask and a bottle of alcohol, ready to spray the hands of clients.\r\n\r\nAll across the country, people are wearing masks. I have even seen cab drivers with face shields.\r\n\r\nThe government has provided hand sanitizer containers in public spaces, and there are signs everywhere warning people not to touch their eyes or mouth and to wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has managed to find a healthy balance while also containing the virus. Life is not normal, but it is not at a standstill as it is in many other countries.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has managed to avoid the chaos seen in neighbors like El Salvador, where the right-wing government shut down the entire economy, leading to\_<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv0zv1Xv0MQ\">massive protests</a>\_by poor residents who are starving.\r\n\r\nThe results speak for themselves. A daily tally provided by the Central American Integration System (<a href=\"https://www.sica.int/coronavirus\">SICA</a>) shows Nicaragua has the fewest cases in the region, even fewer than the much smaller nation of Belize.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua’s right-wing opposition exploits coronavirus to destabilize country</b>\r\n\r\nNicaragua’s relative success in fighting Covid-19 has not stopped the right-wing opposition from using the crisis as an opportunity to turn up the heat on the Sandinistas.\r\n\r\nInformation warfare has been their go-to strategy, spreading fake news to depict the FSLN government as incompetent and unconcerned.\r\n\r\nOpposition media arms like 100% Noticias, a right-wing tabloid station funded indirectly by the US government through the Violeta Chamorro Foundation; along with Confidencial, which is owned by another elite from the Chamorro clan; as well as La Prensa, which also has historically\_<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/24/world/furor-in-nicaragua-on-cia-charges.html\">received financing</a>\_from Washington’s regime-change arm, the National Endowment for Democracy, have all published rumor after rumor as indisputable fact.\r\n\r\nOn a daily basis, these opposition media outlets spread imaginary statistics, claiming without any evidence that the Sandinistas are covering up the actual number of coronavirus cases and deaths.\r\n\r\nRight-wing saboteurs even\_<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Canal4Nica/videos/205790274093519/\">created a fake account</a>\_posing as Nicaragua’s public news station Channel 4 to disseminate fabricated statements they falsely attributed to Vice President Rosario Murillo, claiming school had been cancelled until further notice.\r\n\r\nThe fake video they published went viral, garnering more than 350,000 views on Facebook alone. After two weeks and many reports, Facebook has still not taken it down.\r\n\r\nAn employee at Canal 4 told me that the public media outlet’s real page filed a complaint to Facebook, but instead of removing the fake news, Facebook simply told the owner of the counterfeit account they had to change the profile image so it would not match the logo of the real Canal 4. However, the social media giant has refused to remove the fake Canal 4 account because the real one is not verified (Facebook has rejected its appeals for verification). In the end, Facebook let the users keep the fake name\_ — even while the social media corporation continues its program of\_<a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2020/01/12/us-pressure-social-media-censoring-suspending-venezuela-iran-syria/\">censoring Venezuelans and Iranians under US government pressure</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>The opposition’s information warfare spread confusion among working-class </b>Nicaraguan families, whose children missed school because they thought they were supposed to stay home.\r\n\r\nOpposition hooligans have spread dozens of fake documents claiming to be government press releases, impersonating the\_<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicaraguaNFalsa/status/1248321983953190912\">national police</a>\_and other state institutions.\r\n\r\nRight-wing activists have also tried to\_<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1n8uepTBxk\">blame unrelated deaths</a>\_on Covid-19. When an elderly man passed away from a heart attack in a market, Nicaraguan opposition groups falsely claimed that he had been a victim of coronavirus, and that the government was supposedly covering it up. Anti-government media websites have even used photos from other countries and claimed they are from Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThrough its disinformation campaign, the US-backed Nicaraguan right-wing has endangered public health and spread fear to fuel its ambitions. For the working-class and poor base of the Sandinista Front, the opposition’s cynical actions amid a pandemic are further confirmation of how little it cares for their lives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Doomed if you do, doomed if you don’t</b>\r\n\r\nIn small countries like Nicaragua, the power of the international corporate media can be overwhelming. And the global press has largely joined in the opposition-led effort, using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to relentlessly attack Nicaragua’s government.\r\n\r\nForeign media outlets have falsely claimed, for instance, that the Sandinista Front has continued holding marches amid the coronavirus pandemic. This is not true. Until March, the FSLN had weekly demonstrations called “caminatas” in which thousands of supporters marched in downtown Managua.\r\n\r\nThe last caminata was held on March 14. At the time, there were no Covid-19 cases in Nicaragua. Medical professionals from the Health Ministry participated in the demonstration, and the government provided many signs and posters to help educate the population on how to contain and figure the virus. After that caminata, all of the subsequent marches were cancelled.\r\n\r\nAlongside the Bezos-owned Washington Post, even ostensibly “progressive” outlets like\_<a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/31/headlines/1000s_gather_in_san_salvador_to_demand_coronavirus_aid\">Democracy Now</a>\_have helped advance the demonization campaign against Nicaragua’s government by\_<a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/4/3/headlines/nicaragua_resists_social_distancing_measures_as_covid_19_cases_climb\">repeatedly</a>\_spreading misleading claims about its response to the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nThe wave of negative and falsehood-ridden PR has placed Nicaragua in a difficult quandary. If the Sandinista government decides to respond aggressively to Covid-19, it will be accused of being “authoritarian” and “repressive” (as\_<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/27/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-brought-you-by-authoritarianism/\">China</a>\_was\_<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/\">depicted</a>\_early on in the outbreak). Meanwhile, citizens who toil in the informal economy will face starvation and potentially protest being forced to remain in their homes — as has repeatedly happened in El Salvador, where demonstrators are shouting, “<a href=\"https://www.univision.com/noticias/america-latina/nos-estamos-muriendo-de-hambre-salvadorenos-rompen-la-cuarentena-para-exigir-la-ayuda-que-prometio-bukele\">We are dying of hunger</a>!”\r\n\r\nBut if the government does not respond aggressively enough to the pandemic, and continues the balanced approach it currently pursues, it will continue to be smeared as “<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-2-03-15-20-intl-hnk/h_7f5858d85954296c3b45e9dcec34991d\">irresponsible</a>.”\r\n\r\nFor historically colonized, politically independent countries like Nicaragua, which are under siege by US sanctions, it’s a doomed if you do, doomed if you don’t situation. And even the smallest of decisions can generate massive repercussions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>US sanctions make the situation way worse</b>\r\n\r\nWhile Nicaragua has been taking careful steps to avoid harming its population’s livelihoods, the Trump administration has joined the right-wing opposition it sponsors in using the opportunity to destabilize the Sandinista government.\r\n\r\nLeading up to the pandemic, the US government had imposed several rounds of aggressive sanctions on Nicaragua. In 2018, the\_<a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2018/12/14/congress-sanctions-nicaragua-nica-act/\">US Congress passed the NICA Act without any opposition</a>. This dealt a major blow to Nicaragua’s economy, preventing the country from gaining access to loans and blocking it from working with international financial institutions.\r\n\r\nSince then, the Trump administration has\_<a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/11/27/operation-condor-2-coup-trump-nicaragua-mexico/\">ratcheted up the economic warfare</a>, with new measures declared on March 5, just as the Covid-19 outbreak was spreading.\r\n\r\nConcerns over the damage this has done to the Nicaraguan people led the Sandinista government to join Cuba, Venezuela, China, Russia, Iran, Syria, and the DPRK in signing an open letter calling on the UN to take action to lift the illegal, unilateral coercive measures targeting their economies.\r\n\r\nProminent Sandinista activists I spoke with expressed concerns that the US government might use the pandemic as an opportunity to trap poor countries in the Global South in debt bondage. Washington could then leverage the debt to force the countries to fork over their natural resources, privatize state institutions, and open up their economies for plunder by multi-national corporations.\r\n\r\nFor those weathering the storm of neocolonialism, Covid-19 is a threat, but just one in a disturbingly long list of them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Strict Protocols against Covid-19\r\n</b>Carlos Sáenz , secretary general of the Health Ministry, explained that Nicaragua has established strict protocols that are followed when a positive case of Coronavirus is detected: \"From the moment a case is confirmed positive, the patient receives medical treatment, contact tracing starts immediately along with home isolation for contacts with daily follow-up by phone calls and visits by Health personnel.”\_ Each Local Comprehensive Health System (SILAIS) has access to the database of all the people who are under a fourteen-day home isolation either because they are contacts of positive cases or have arrived from other countries but remain asymptomatic. \"At this time, Nicaragua does not have community transmission of Coronavirus and to maintain this situation it is essential that we continue to apply a protocol of early identification, contact tracing and isolation that is endorsed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO),” (Nicaragua News, 4/8/20)\r\n\r\n<b>Nicaragua Has Lowest Contagion Rate in Americas\r\n</b>On April 14 there have been a total of nine people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Nicaragua.
