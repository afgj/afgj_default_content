The WSJ admits that the White House showed “excessive optimism” and suffered from what critics called “unrealistic expectations that [US] pressure tactics” would easily force Maduro from power. The newspaper acknowledges that Maduro’s position is secure despite debilitating US oil sanctions and attempted international isolation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/09/sexy-tricks-journalists-demonize-venezuela-anatoly-kurmanaev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/09/sexy-tricks-journalists-demonize-venezuela-anatoly-kurmanaev/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576345384103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-DlKvzrsIvA6CK9C8ReHQxOuUog\">'Sexy tricks': How journalists demonize Venezuela’s socialist government, in their own words</a> Journalists revealed to me the tactics they use to sell stories painting Venezuela as a socialist dystopia. One described himself as a “mercenary,” explaining how he aims to please his employer’s funders.

The mass communications media have played an important role in discrediting progressive governments, discrediting social movements, eroding popular support for processes of change. They have done so through disinformation campaigns that manipulate facts and impose post-truth as a constant to shape the population's understanding of the world and thus too their political behavior.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.resumen-english.org/2019/12/abstract-leftism-leaves-bolivia-and-the-global-south-in-imperialist-crosshairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.resumen-english.org/2019/12/abstract-leftism-leaves-bolivia-and-the-global-south-in-imperialist-crosshairs/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576345384103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC50S_MZWdkiQ-bvsEdoHRYxnReQ\">Netfa Freeman: Faux Left Leaves Bolivia and the Global South in Imperialist Crosshairs </a>“Progressive leftist” in the U.S., also known as liberals who claim to oppose U.S. Empire but who have an aversion to making regime change methods of imperialism concrete and comprehensive cannot be described as anything less than nauseating.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary obligation of anti-imperialists who are not Bolivian and reside in the belly of the beast should be to expose and oppose US imperialism in Bolivia, and it’s pervasive and covert and overt foreign policies.

Day in and day out, “reputable” establishment outlets bombard progressive and/or anti-imperialist governments in the Global South with endless salvos of smears and libelous misrepresentations. But corporate outlets have not been alone in attacking Morales. Progressive and alternative media in the Global North have long portrayed Bolivia’s deposed Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) government as repressive, pro-capitalist and anti-environment—all in the name of “left” critique.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/07/us-government-dropped-charges-max-blumenthal-arrest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/07/us-government-dropped-charges-max-blumenthal-arrest/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576345384103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdkkwk8qW91emwEigaxa59SxY3yw\">US drops false charge against journalist Max Blumenthal, related to Venezuela Embassy protection reporting</a> The US government has dropped a false charge of assault against The Grayzone editor Max Blumenthal stemming from an incident at the Venezuelan embassy in May. Blumenthal was seized from his home by a group of officers and held for two days in cells and cages.

Venezuela’s Bolivarian Militia was formed in 2005 and granted autonomy in 2008 by Hugo Chavez.

Its oil production increased by more than 20% in November and reached its highest level since the U.S. tightened its sanctions against the state-owned company PDVSA in August. The average pumping of Venezuelan oil increased from 761,000 barrels per day (BPD) in October to 926,000 BPD in November.
