In the November\_election, Murillo, wife of President Daniel Ortega, was elected in her own\_right as vice-president for the next five years.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Women as Protagonists of Change</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"We aspire to the full protagonism of all women in Nicaragua,\" Murillo said\_in August after her candidacy for the vice presidency was announced. \"We\_know, we feel, that we have always worked with and for women. Women\_are fighters, warriors. As more women are present in the economic, social\_and political spaces, more women’s leadership is promoted because we\_have identified our leadership abilities” One of the objectives achieved by\_Murillo this year has not only\_been the achievement of\_50% of women in\_elected and appointed positions of relevance in the State, but\_also\_that\_women recognize their role in a time when, on a global level, women are\_raising their voices, organizing and showing that men and women are\_complementary, and that gender equality and inclusion, at least in\_Nicaragua,\_come\_from above. Meaning that those who lead the country\_have integrated this objective into the strategies and plans of the\_government and are implementing it in operational policies, showing that\_beyond tokenism, women are prepared to take on their role and assume it\_fully.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">FSLN COHESION</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rosario Murillo has created a new way of campaigning, breaking with all\_traditional schemes and forms. With her there has been no need to be a\_leader making speeches, or\_gathering\_large groups of people.\_Her\_leadership of\_organized youth to visit house by house, neighborhood by\_neighborhood, region by region,\_aligning\_the whole apparatus of\_the\_central and municipal governments to develop public works in time and\_form, enabling a campaign based on solutions offered to the population\_and not mere rhetorical promises,\_has\_allowed the FSLN to position itself\_as the national party.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UNAFFECTED BY\_ATTACKS</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rosario Murillo has managed to overcome in an elegant and\_unconventional manner the attacks, caricatures, denigration of her\_qualifications, and misogyny, knowing that she has been exposed to the\_attacks because she is a public figure and\_she\_has not allowed that to faze\_her, or diminish her enthusiasm and ability to work. She has been\_consistent between what she says and what she does, being a true leader,\_working long days without rest driving this government. Her close\_collaborators say that she is addicted to work in the good sense of the\_word, and that has produced remarkable results for the government,\_results admired by Nicaraguans and foreigners.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">016: The Year of Rosario Murillo</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"La Compañera\" Rosario Murillo, as she is recognized and called in the\_Government and the Sandinista Front, has had a rebound of popularity\_and acceptance of her impressive governmental management this year,\_when she was elected Vice President for the five-year period 2017-2021.\_\_2016 was an exceptional year for the government presided over by\_President Daniel Ortega. Against all odds, Ortega contradicted what many\_analysts believed \_was a natural law: that every government and its top\_leaders begin their periods with high approval ratings, but\_tend\_to lose\_popularity as time goes by\_and\_they do not deliver on what they promised\_or do so half-way, and end their terms with high disapproval rates.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Raul Obregon, general manager of the polling firm M &amp; R Consultants told\_Informe Pastran, “Contradicting this quasi-law, the government of\_President Ortega ends the period 2012-2016 with approval rates higher\_than those it started with: 63.3% in 2012 and 67.2% in 2016.” He\_emphasized that \"In line with the approval of the government, Rosario\_Murillo achieved the highest ratings of the period: 67.2% approved of the\_work she did in 2016.\_Comparing this to her 28.0% approval\_rating\_obtained at the beginning of the 2007-2011 government period, the result\_clearly demonstrates that when a government and its main officials focus\_their efforts on responding to the most felt needs and demands of the\_population in general, and mainly of the segments of greatest social and\_economic vulnerability, it is possible to increase the approval of the\_population during the term of office.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In 2007, only 28% approved of Murillo; in 2008 it was 14.4%;\_it rose\_to\_29.6% in 2009;\_but dropped to\_29.1% in 2010. Her approval rebounded to\_63.3% in 2011, followed by 62.7% in 2012; 63% in 2013; 63.1% in 2014;\_61.8% in 2015 and 67.2% in 2016.\_Obregon continued,\_“With these results\_we see it confirmed that the approval rates by the population are\_determined by the work done by the government and /or government\_officials, and that when the product of such work is pro-population, the\_population without doubt recognizes it. When governments and officials do\_not respond to their needs, the population disapproves and punishes the\_government and its officials.” As for the political opposition, it ended 2016\_with\_no notable leader and with the majority of the population holding a\_negative opinion of it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">MANY FACTORS\_IN HER FAVOR</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"For some, Rosario Murillo is, along with her husband the Commander and\_President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega, one of the most representative\_figures of the Sandinista revolution, while for others, she is only \"la\_compañera\"\_who has\_taken charge of bringing all kinds of cultural activities\_to the most remote villages in her country,\" said the prestigious Forbes\_magazine, which placed her among the most powerful and influential\_women in Central America this year.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The reelection of President Daniel Ortega last November and Murillo as\_Vice President of the country has its explanation in numbers that dispel the\_opposition's challenges.\_According to The Wire, a web portal of The\_Atlantic,\_\"Ortega won 72% of the votes and enjoys a 70% approval rate;\_his socialist policies are also well accepted. The economy has grown\_steadily by an average of 5.16% in the last five years (2011-2015), more\_than double the region's average of 2.08%.\" \_In a pre-election report, the\_BBC acknowledged that Murillo \"is very dear to poor Nicaraguans and\_Sandinistas, so she consistently has 70% approval levels.\" Nevertheless,\_her critics and detractors\_attack her\_daily in editorials, reviews, comments\_and cartoons, focusing on banalities rather than measuring her results in\_government.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">HER\_PUBLIC FACE</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"She has already been involved in the key decisions that affect the country\_and has advised the president, so now she is just trying to get an\_appropriate title for that role\_[as Vice President of the country],\"\_said\_Michael Allison, political science professor at the University of Scranton.\_\_Her critics write about her with great imagination but do not dare to deny\_that Murillo is a hard-working and tireless leader. Christine Wade, a\_political science scholar at Washington College of Maryland, adds, \"She is\_in people's homes all the time. She has become the public face of the\_administration and I think it has helped immensely to increase its\_popularity.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“THE PARTNER\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rosario Murillo is seen as a person who commands, who has decision\_power, who listens, resolves, who is very sensitive to the needy, who is\_informed about everything, down to the smallest details, but at the same\_time is the main critic of the government, who calls public officials onto the\_carpet, and is the most demanding about fulfilling the plans and tasks that\_the Executive has proposed ... Every time that floods occur, landslides,\_misfortunes, many of the affected appeal to her, trusting that they will\_receive a response. \_A peasant\_womanwho lost her house\_during\_the flood\_of the Ochomogo River in Nandaime asked Murillo through Channel 10 to\_help her. \"I know she will listen to me, that she will attend to me. I know\_that she is going to help me; she supports the poor,\" said the affected\_woman. Among poor women she is admired. Opposition politicians and\_businessmen respect her. Only old comrades from the FSLN and the\_government of the eighties are detractors, plus some Catholic clerics.\_Meanwhile she appears on Channel 4 to give her daily information briefing\_by telephone, serene and unperturbed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">RECOGNITION OF GENDER EQUALITY</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Coordinator of the Communication and Citizenship Council and now as\_the elected Vice-President of the country, Rosario Murillo has managed to\_maintain the cohesion of the state apparatus around the government’s\_program without diminishing even a bit the priority given to the social\_impact projects that the executive branch calls Restitution of Rights. This\_social component was not only decisive in moving thousands of\_Nicaraguans out of extreme poverty, boosting micro-enterprise, and\_empowering women through microcredit, but it also enabled them to win a\_great deal of support for the Sandinista leadership. \_At the same time,\_Murillo stood as the embodiment of gender protagonism in Nicaragua,\_empowering thousands upon thousands of women with her actions making\_gender equality an accent of this government ... The World Economic\_Forum said that Nicaragua is the most gender equal country of the region,\_as it ranks 12 among 145 countries measured worldwide, but we are\_number one in Latin America.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">BRIEFS</span></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Despite the volatility of the global economy, the slowdown in\_Europe, the weak growth of the United States and the decelerating growth\_in China, Nicaragua was praised in 2016 by multilateral financial\_organizations, risk rating agencies and entrepreneurs in the region, for\_achieving sustained growth of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) an\_average of close to 5%, coupled with the continued reduction of extreme\_poverty, rising foreign direct investment, a construction boom, citizen\_security and social peace.\_(Informe Pastran, Dec. 29)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Travel and Leisure magazine has named Nicargua one of the 50\_best places to get to know in 2017. Nicaragua and Panama were the only\_two countries in Central America to make the list. Officials project 1.5\_million tourists will visit Nicaragua in 2017.\_(El Nuevo Diario, Dec. 30;\_<a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/best-places-to-travel-in-2017\">http://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/best-places-to-travel-in-2017</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">One hundred thousand new vehicles were registered in Nicaragua\_this year raising to 800,000 the number of vehicles on the road. National\_Transit Commissioner General Roberto Gonzalez commented, “It is\_positive because it demonstrates the economic development of the nation.”\_But he also pointed out that, with more drivers, the risk of accidents also\_has increased. Traffic fatalities increased by 100 to 780 in 2015.\_(El Nuevo\_Diario, Dec. 29)</li>\n</ul>"
