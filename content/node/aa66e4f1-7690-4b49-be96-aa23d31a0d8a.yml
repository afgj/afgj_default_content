Before the first case was identified, there were 820 million people suffering from hunger worldwide; 2.2 billion people with no access to fresh water; 4.2 billion without access to safely managed sanitation services and 3 billion lacking basic amenities for hand washing. This scenario becomes more inadmissible when it is known that globally around 6.7 billion dollars are spent on a yearly basis only in advertising, while military expenditure amounts to 1.8 trillion dollars that are completely useless in the combat against the COVID19 threat, which has already taken the lives of tens of thousands of people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Countries with more available resources should share them with most affected countries that are least prepared to cope with the pandemic.That is Cuba’s approach. The humble contribution of a small nation with limited natural resources and submitted to a long and brutal economic blockade.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://greensocialthought.org/content/cuba-aids-dengue-and-ebola-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://greensocialthought.org/content/cuba-aids-dengue-and-ebola-covid-19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIg7j-05yeu229p_y-b_YeHDXV6Q\">Green Social Thought (Don Fitz): Cuba: From AIDS, Dengue, and Ebola to COVID-19</a> A review of Cuba’s history of humanitarian internationalism, and a comparison of the Cuban and US approaches to medical care.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/analysis/COVID-19-International-Solidarity-vs.-Sanctions-in-Times-of-Global-Pandemic-20200415-0018.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telesurenglish.net/analysis/COVID-19-International-Solidarity-vs.-Sanctions-in-Times-of-Global-Pandemic-20200415-0018.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-NhkXBB--Wgjqjq4eRjkLI7CuRw\">TeleSur: Solidarity vs. Sanctions in Times of a Global Pandemic</a> Faced with the chaos of the pandemic, the international solidarity of China and Cuba helps us understand the shortcomings of the neoliberal capitalist system. Chinese and Cuban doctors have been providing support in Iran, Italy, Spain and have offered their services and expertise to the most vulnerable countries in Latin America, Africa, and Europe. China, for its part, has sent health aid to more than 80 countries. In the cases of Italy, Spain, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran and other countries, the Chinese government also sent doctors and infectologists specialized in treating the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.workers.org/2020/04/47704/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.workers.org/2020/04/47704/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcHxcYl8DfHCzj5OrhMnkypP1XGw\">Workers.org: Cuban solidarity combats the pandemic from Italy to Angola</a> Cuba organized medical brigades within a week’s time to travel to 14 countries to combat the virus. Some 256 Cuban health workers, including 188 physicians and 24 nurses, arrived in Angola on April 10 to aid in the fight against COVID-19, after 19 people had become infected there.Socialist collaboration and cooperation enabled the quick mobilization of the teams. Cobas said Cuba, with 89,000 doctors and 84,000 nurses, has the highest ratio of doctors in the world — 9 per 1,000 residents — which is three times the U.S. rate! That is why the island can send health workers abroad. It has also sent materials and treatments.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://tonyseed.wordpress.com/2020/04/16/campaign-tosupport-cubas-contribution-to-world-fight-against-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tonyseed.wordpress.com/2020/04/16/campaign-tosupport-cubas-contribution-to-world-fight-against-covid-19/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBmYKETd-7dZoMfFZpxwr04Hti7w\">Canadian Network on Cuba:\_ Campaign to Support Cuba’s Contribution to World Fight Against COVID-19 </a>Cuba has more than 800 medical personnel serving humanity in the trenches of 16 countries against the dreaded coronavirus.To contribute to the Campaign to Support Cuba’s Contribution to World Fight Against COVID-19: cheques should be made out to the “CNC,” with “COVID-19” written in the memo, and then mailed to: c/o Sharon Skup, 56 Riverwood Terrace, Bolton ON L7E 1S4</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2020-04-13/us-company-buys-ventilator-supplier-and-cancels-shipments-to-cuba-citing-blockade?fbclid=IwAR0LS60bOIodIQU17ZQTRsutpTlNYIqBJ65zny4EsQrPBdMALGwN1t8wTWA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2020-04-13/us-company-buys-ventilator-supplier-and-cancels-shipments-to-cuba-citing-blockade?fbclid%3DIwAR0LS60bOIodIQU17ZQTRsutpTlNYIqBJ65zny4EsQrPBdMALGwN1t8wTWA&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-j39ZlTwS7PI3ejArcpD2d1FR5g\">Granma: U.S. company buys ventilator supplier and cancels shipments to Cuba citing blockade</a> While Cuban medical collaboration is extended around the world to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, the insane blockade imposed by the United States on our country, has just denied our public health system access to two regular suppliers of ventilators, key to the care of the most serious cases of the disease.In another twist of this genocidal, inhumane policy, the manufacturers IMTMedical AG and Acutronic, announced the end of commercial relations with Cuba, after the companies were acquired by the U.S. firm Vyaire Medical Inc.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Venezuela\r\n<a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Venezuela-Seeks-to-Perform-10-Million-Tests-for-COVID-19-20200416-0002.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Venezuela-Seeks-to-Perform-10-Million-Tests-for-COVID-19-20200416-0002.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXyd_XpaRNYis7wCgJ1siUKmoqrA\">TeleSur: Venezuela Seeks to Perform 10 Million Tests for COVID-19</a> Something the US is still unable to do? \"We have to get at least 10 million tests with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization, China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba,\" Maduro said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://orinocotribune.com/maduro-is-warned-an-abrupt-transition-will-be-forced-maduro-responds-cool-your-jets-elliott/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orinocotribune.com/maduro-is-warned-an-abrupt-transition-will-be-forced-maduro-responds-cool-your-jets-elliott/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRiME4rdr9zqgS-SFEQMnhqOs6FA\">OrinocoTribune: Maduro is Warned an Abrupt Transition Will be Forced – Maduro Responds: “Cool Your Jets, Elliott”</a>US warns Venezuelan President Maduro that if he does not accept Washington’s “transition” plan, he will force a more “dangerous” transition.

With little hope of electoral success and its base more divided than ever, it has resorted to spreading mountains of fake news, printing demonstrably false information in hopes of stirring up a frenzy among the population.Nicaragua boasts a system of socialized medicine that provides high-quality healthcare to all residents, at no cost – an achievement made possible by the Sandinistas’ national electoral victory in 2006.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Webinars and Actions</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://popularresistance.org/act-now-to-stop-the-us-war-on-venezuela/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://popularresistance.org/act-now-to-stop-the-us-war-on-venezuela/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm5ODwumfDUIM_RFO8kszRBkU3IA\">PopularResistance: Act Now to Help Stop US War on Venezuela</a> Four actions you can take to defend Venezuela.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/steven-hahn-fda-expedite-review-and-approval-of-lifesaving-cuban-antiviral-for-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.change.org/p/steven-hahn-fda-expedite-review-and-approval-of-lifesaving-cuban-antiviral-for-covid-19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeNK7-YMaHwKuOVRfKO_WdGa2ezg\">Sign-on Letter: FDA expedite review and approval of lifesaving Cuban antiviral for COVID-19</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/263573141712204/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/events/263573141712204/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHY_MHiikL8vBnpbzP_pdAakMiAXA\">April 17, 2pm ET: Webinar: COVID-19 in Brazil</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/521e46594a6a/us-women-cuba-march-news-3249873?e=70d5aebbf4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailchi.mp/521e46594a6a/us-women-cuba-march-news-3249873?e%3D70d5aebbf4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkwoKQ2Q8BUcZfpT82sZmJPaRGiw\">Webinar April 18th, 2pm ET U.S.- Cuba-Canada Collaboration in Fighting COVID-19</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/902465500176422/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/events/902465500176422/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEaIdQdyWQhPkM7UQP4IYt5Yx9VmQ\">April 19 Webinar: The Prosecution of Julian Assange and the Fight for Free Speech</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuCrvGdWShmboqTZoBq5xuyFQg1-6a8FxZ5xn9cpOrhoMo4A/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuCrvGdWShmboqTZoBq5xuyFQg1-6a8FxZ5xn9cpOrhoMo4A/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587224971037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdqh9tfYHorZLtqXcUQDn8dL6MhQ\">April 23 webinar: An Inside View of Resistance to US Imperialism in Venezuela and How to Build International Solidarity</a></p>"
