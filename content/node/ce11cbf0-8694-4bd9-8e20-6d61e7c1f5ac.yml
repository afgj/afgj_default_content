The NICA Act\_(Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2017), if it became law, would\_require US representatives in multilateral lending institutions to vote against\_loans to Nicaragua until the Sandinista government overthrows itself and turns\_over power to the US-approved opposition whose support among voters is in\_the single digits.\n\nI’ve discussed the NICA Act several times in this space. I have not changed my\_assessment that it is not ever going to become law, but there are others who\_take it more seriously and certainly the spurious claims made recently by\_Global Witness that Nicaragua is the most dangerous country in the world for\_environmentalists will play into the discourse of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and other\_far-right Congresscritters. So, we can’t just ignore it, no matter how slim the\_prospects of it becoming the law of the land. At the end of this blog I’ll suggest\_some actions solidarity activists should take during the August congressional\_recess during which time nothing will move forward in Congress.\n\nI think it is worth reproducing in its entirety the Nicaraguan government’s\_response to the congressional committee’s action, not just for the zinger at the\_end, but so we can see how the language used by the Sandinista government\_has changed while still defending the same principles of sovereignty and self-determination that it defended in the 1980s. Here it is:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, learning of\_the Introduction of the Legislative Initiative known as NICA-ACT\_in the Congress of the United States, communicates the following\_to our People:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1. We reject and condemn the NICA-ACT as the continuation of\_the historical United States Policy of imperial interference in\_Nicaragua.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">2. Our Country will continue to develop its Policies and Proposals\_for National Unity, in accordance with our Constitutional\_Commitments, and our Realities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">3. The Christian, Socialist and Sovereign Nicaragua, will continue\_to develop its Model of Dialogue, Alliances and Consensus,\_which has secured Reconciliation, Peace and Unity, allowing us\_to face all challenges with Faith and Optimism.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">4. In a Year of Municipal Electoral Processes, we continue to\_create optimal conditions for Nicaraguan Families to express their\_Will, and to elect their Local Governments in Social Harmony, and\_to guarantee the Peace that we all seek, with Our efforts and\_daily work.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">5. Our People have ratified this Blessed and Free Nicaragua,\_consolidating a Model and a Project that includes us all as\_Protagonists of Democracy, Freedom, Security, Advancing along\_routes of prosperity.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">6. The Nicaraguan State has initiated Legal Proceedings which\_will enable us to require that the United States of America, honor\_Payment of the Indemnity ordered in 1986 by the International\_Court of Justice at The Hague, as compensation for the fatal\_damages caused to the People and Government of Nicaragua,\_for the destructive and illegal interference of that Power in our\_National Affairs.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Nicaraguan State will demand the right of our country to be\_recognized today, with resources that will be used to promote\_Peace, Democracy and Development.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Managua, July 27, 2017</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Government of Reconciliation</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">And National Unity</p>\nThe US government ignores that it owes Nicaragua an estimated $17 billion,\_plus 31 years of interest, for its illegal Contra War to overthrow the Sandinista\_government in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan and continued under George\_H. W. Bush. The International Court of Justice at The Hague (World Court)\_found the US liable for the death and destruction of that war in 1986. The Court\_had not yet ruled on a dollar amount, but the Nicaragua government had\_developed a rigorous system which determined the deaths, loss of limbs,\_destroyed infrastructure and lost economic activity were valued at $17 billion.\n\nSomeone more wonkish than I am could probably calculate how much interest\_has increased that figure and how much the pittance of foreign aid from the US\_has decreased it. US intervention in the 1990 presidential election resulted in\_the Sandinistas losing the government and one of the first acts taken by US-backed President Violeta Chamorro was to drop the World Court case.\_President Ortega officially reinstated the case when he returned to elected\_office in 2007. Nicaragua Network has repeatedly reminded people of the US\_legal debt to Nicaragua over the years and to remind people that any US aid\_has only been small payments on our country’s large debt to that country.\n\nAs presidential advisor and former Sandinista Comandante Bayardo Arce has\_pointed out, Nicaragua currently receives no government to government aid\_from the US with the exception of some small Drug War grants to the Army. So,\_a cut-off of US aid would only affect the political parties and civil society groups\_who are funded by US “democracy promotion” programs to undermine\_democracy and political stability. It would be surprising if those funds were cut\_off.\n\nBut the NICA Act doesn’t address US aid, it addresses international loans. And\_cutting Nicaragua’s access to international loans and grants would hurt the\_economy and poverty reduction programs. How much is a bit hard to calculate.\_I saw one report using a figure of 70% with regard to foreign aid and the\_Nicaraguan budget but it was unclear what the 70% figure was referring to. By\_our calculations, about 11.5% of Nicaragua’s national budget is funded by\_international aid and loans. That money is almost entirely used by the\_government to fund social programs, which includes programs such as Zero\_Hunger and Zero Usury as well as infrastructure such as farm to market roads\_and overland connections between the Pacific and Caribbean sides of the\_country.\n\nIn the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the US has traditionally\_held veto power even though its percentage of votes is less than a fifth of that\_of all the countries with seats on the governing boards. Would the other\_countries respect a Trump Administration veto like it has other US\_administrations? I don’t know what the voting rules are. I do know that the\_Inter-American Development Bank has changed its voting rules so that now no\_country can veto a loan by itself. But, to further complicate a risk assessment\_on passage of the NICA Act is the fact that other multilateral lenders and most\_bilateral donors and lenders follow the lead of the IMF. A US veto of an IMF\_loan could potentially cause Nicaragua’s access to foreign aid and loans, other\_than from Russia and China, to dry up which would force it to reduce the\_national budget by over 10%. That would be a major blow to any country.\n\nTherefore we have to act as if the NICA Act were a serious threat instead of\_grandstanding for Miami right-wing donors and activists which is what I think it\_is. Your Members of Congress are home in their districts right now and\_Senators will be there in another two weeks. The District visits are going to be\_dominated by the healthcare issue but it is our best opportunity to drive a stake\_through the heart of the NICA Act, so please take advantage of this month\_when every member of Congress will be kicking off their re-election campaign\_and a third of the Senators will be too, to meet with them and their staff, or to\_bring up the NICA Act in public meetings. Hardly any of them will have any idea\_what the NICA Act even is, so if you can plant the idea that it is a bad thing\_now, we’ll be way ahead in the battle if the bill moves forward to votes in the\_House and Senate.\n\nAnd, it seems to me that we have one powerful argument why House and\_Senate members should vote against the NICA Act. It is a reason that should\_appeal to Democrats and Republicans, liberals and libertarians and it doesn’t\_depend on the politician being a decent human being or even a rational one.\_That reason is that right now there are very few Nicaraguans among the\_thousands of Hondurans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Mexicans trying to\_enter the US from the south. It is not in US national security interest to damage\_Nicaragua’s economy. The result will not be to change the government, but\_only to add Nicaraguans to the flow of migrants and refugees flowing north. If\_that is not a persuasive argument, then neither will be any other that we can\_put forward.\n\nWe will have more actions to take when Congress comes back into session\_and we get a clearer idea if the NICA Act is going anywhere. It would still have\_to be voted on in the full House, a subcommittee and the Senate Foreign\_Relations Committee would have to hold hearings and vote on it, then Mitch\_McConnell would have to schedule it for a vote in the Senate which would\_require 60 votes to open debate if even one Senator makes that demand. If\_there are any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, a\_conference committee would have to resolve the differences before both\_chambers of the legislature vote on the final bill. Only then would it go to the\_president for his signature or veto. Judging by comments of his ambassador to\_Nicaragua, Laura Dogu, damaging Nicaragua’s economy is not a priority of the\_Trump State Department. Of course, we don’t want it to get that far, so it is\_important that we take advantage of the August recess to let our elected\_officials know that we oppose the NICA Act and that we care about how they\_vote on it.\n\n<hr />\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>BRIEFS</strong>\nLeonardo Torres, president of the Nicaraguan Council of the Micro,\_Small and Medium Enterprise (Conimipyme), reported that “almost 45% of\_Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is produced by micro, small and medium\_enterprises. He said there are only about 400 large companies in Nicaragua\_while the MIPYMEs number about 180,000, 52% of which are\_microenterprises. The government of President Daniel Ortega has paid\_particular attention to building this sector of the economy, including peasant\_agriculture. Perhaps uniquely among nations, the government has prioritized\_ensuring that MIPYMEs are not wiped out by big companies during the\_explosive growth of the tourism industry. (El Nuevo Diario, July 31)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>US Ambassador Laura Dogu announced that the Trump administration\_has made no decision one way or the other about extending Temporary\_Protected Status (TPS) to the citizens of any country other than Haiti who are\_residing in the United States. The Trump administration extended TPS for\_Haitians for six months, but Dogu was clear that Nicaraguans should not make\_any assumptions that their protected status will be extended, or that it won’t.\_Central Americans, especially Salvadorans, Hondurans, and some\_Nicaraguans received TPS following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Successive US\_presidents have extended TPS since then. Dogu gave no timeline for a\_decision. (El Nuevo Diario, July 26)</li>\n</ul>"
