      value: "<b>Nicaraguan Opposition Praises Bolivian Coup</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Chuck Kaufman</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who remains under the illusion that the opposition behind the 2018 failed coup in Nicaragua was rising up from the Left should wake up and smell the coffee as the groups representing the coup mongers fall over themselves to praise the ultra-right, anti-indigenous coup in Bolivia. Have you seen the quote from the self-declared “President” of Bolivia, opposition legislator </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeanine Anez?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I dream of a Bolivia free of satanic indigenous rituals. The city is not for the Indians, they should go to the highlands or to Chaco!” the Evangelical Christian-Fascist said in 2006.\_ This virulent strain of racism against the indigenous peoples of Bolivia is a return to governance by the traditional Bolivian oligarchy which has always had the support of the US government and transnational corporations. This is the kind of friends that even the Sandinista Renovation Movement is consorting with these days and for the last several years.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is interesting to note that Amnesty International, which has had a lot of anti-government, poorly documented accusations to make against the government of Nicaragua, has said not one word about the violent coup in Bolivia that has left at least 18 supporters of the constitutional government dead. I have not seen statements by any other corporate-supported international human rights organizations that would indicate any concern about human rights in Bolivia.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also worth noting that the Peasant Movement of Nicaragua from Exile, which brought to fame </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Francisca Ramirez (supposedly a peasant environmentalist being repressed by the Ortega government), has taken the side of the Bolivian oligarchy, calling them “brothers” in their statement below.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The putsch in Nicaragua in April 2018, was the first test of the Trump regime to overthrow the governments of the so-called “Pink Tide” that was fulfilling Bolivar’s dream of a politically and economically integrated Latin America independent of the “Colossus of the North.” The coup effort failed there and multiple attempts failed in Venezuela as the most recent effort by US anointed fake president Juan Guido fell flat this past Saturday.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The jury is still out on whether it will succeed in Bolivia as the unions and popular movements that brought Evo Morales to power through the ballot box, and which forced the resignation of successive neoliberal governments prior to his election, organize a strong fight-back to the coup. On the political side, the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) political party, which controls the national legislature, managed to run a police gauntlet and achieve a quorum to elect new officers in place of those forced out by the army. They now have the stronger case of constitutional succession to the presidency than the racist Jeanine Anez! Whether the constitutional order will be restored will depend on the courage of the Bolivian people and the solidarity of the international community.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as the Nicaraguan opposition goes, we know them by their words and their actions. Below are the English translations of the tweets above. Pay particular attention to what our former friends in the MRS have to say, especially their praise for the Bolivian army and police and their claim of proven electoral fraud, when three weeks after the election not a shred of evidence of fraud has been presented in any national or international forum.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12262 size-large\" src=\"https://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pdfresizer.com-pdf-crop-page-001-911x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"845\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>11 Nov at 18:09</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolivians demonstrated that unity is the key to asserting the will of the people.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"...THESE EVENTS SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO THE ILLEGITIMATE REGIMES IN VENEZUELA AND NICARAGUA THAT DEMOCRACY AND THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL\" - Extract from President Donald J.

The march \"We All Have Rights, We Are Millions\" was held in support of the Sandinista Government which for 13 years has given progress and restauration of rights to Nicaraguan families. There were messages such as: “Nicaragua is in solidarity with Bolivia,” repudiating the coup d'état, asking for peace and the return of the former president, Evo Morales, with the proclamation \"Evo, friend, the people are with you.\" The Sandinista “May 4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Movement” declared itself in support of the self-determination of the Bolivian people and expressed its trust that President Morales will win the battle against the coup plotters. \"We must confront the U.S. power and European power that does so much damage to the world,\" said Juan Carlos Ortega of the Sandinista 4 de Mayo Movement. \"We can no longer let them impose their way of looking at life on us.

Present were the mayors of Rosita, Bonanza and Siuna. José Luis Solórzano, departmental political secretary of the FSLN in the Mining Triangle, said that the Mayangna nation has been consolidated with those who work to ensure further development. Solorzano referred to the situation in Bolivia saying, \"We have witnessed a coup d'état in Bolivia; the indigenous people of Bolivia marginalized by the mere fact of having an indigenous president, the best president of Bolivia who brought joy and happiness that the right-wing and the U.S. government forced out.” He stressed that the indigenous people are in struggle in Bolivia and the US-backed right-wing minorities have orchestrated the coup d'état in that country. Aurelia Paterson, of the Tuahka territorial government, said the Rosita Indians are with Evo Morales, who was forced to resign to save his life and that of his people. \"Evo is not alone, the world is with you, many indigenous people of Nicaragua are with you, we ask that in the world the North American empire ends,\" she said. The Mayangna Nation is made up of nine indigenous territories located on the North and South Caribbean Coast and in the Jinotega department.
