My basic conclusion is: how can it be any worse than it has been under Obama’s\_presidency, or would have been under Hillary Clinton’s presidency?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since Bill Clinton, Democrats have sub-contracted US policy toward Latin America to the far-right, self-exiled, Cuban counter-revolutionaries and their legislative champions, past and\_present, including Jesse Helms, Robert Torricelli, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Robert Menendez,\_plus a raft of mid-level State Department career diplomats. Ronald Reagan created the National\_Endowment for Democracy (NED) “to do overtly what the CIA did covertly 25 years ago,”\_according to one of NED’s architects. Of course, the CIA never stopped its dirty deeds. My\_favorite Facebook meme currently is “What? The Russians hacked the US election? I can’t hear\_you over the laughter from ALL of Latin America.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But it was Clinton who completed the make-over of the US Agency for International Development\_(USAID) from a bricks and mortar agency to an election manipulation agency under the guise of\_“democracy promotion.” That didn’t change any under Bush the Younger or Barack Obama.\_\_Indeed, Obama has been worse for Latin America than Bush was. His government continues to\_its last days to support the illegitimate coup government of Honduras. He supported the\_legislative coups in Paraguay and Brazil. He’s spent tens of millions of dollars to affect “regime\_change” in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador, and picked fights with Christina Fernandez’\_government in Argentina. His State Department and USAID representatives attacked\_Nicaragua’s elections in a House hearing a few months ago on the perfidious NICA Act. While\_saying that the administration didn’t support blocking all international loans to Nicaragua,\_nevertheless they repeated all the right-wing talking points about why the bill should be passed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So how could Trump make it any worse other than by sending the Marines to invade a Latin\_American country?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, that doesn’t mean he’s going to make it any better. It is not a good sign that Trump\_appointed former Marine Lt. Gen. John F. Kelly, who headed the Southern Command which\_projects US military might in Latin America, as head of Homeland Security. Kelly is an ideologue\_who ought to be brought before the International Criminal Court for torture given his treatment of\_prisoners at the illegal US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But, his mission at Homeland\_Security is to “secure US borders,” not to formulate policy toward Latin America. It is possible he\_might even favor policies that reduce the numbers of refugees streaming north.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Trump’s pick for Secretary of State,\_Exxon Mobil CEO\_Rex Tillerson, is, of course, an oil man,\_and that can’t be good. Exxon Mobil has a legal dispute with Venezuela that is not likely to\_indicate he’ll support normalizing relations with Maduro’s government, but on the other hand,\_he’s not likely to be more hostile to the Venezuelan government than is already established\_policy. At best, his and Trump’s attention will be turned to other parts of the world, especially\_improving relations with Russia, which is a good thing. History shows that Latin America thrives\_in periods of US inattention.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But, the Cuban right-wing is deeply entrenched in the State Department, and the idea that Latin\_America is the testing ground for US economic and military experiments is a fundamental\_principle of the foreign policy culture. My conclusion therefore is that US policies in this\_hemisphere, under a Trump presidency, are not going to be any better than they were under\_Obama, but probably not any worse either. The Latin America solidarity movement will be called\_upon to continue to work to change US policy and to walk the path of solidarity with Nicaragua\_and all the movements for justice, sovereignty, and peace in Latin America.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">BRIEFS</span></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Jose Adan Aguerri, president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP)\_reported that by 2018 Nicaragua should be ready to accept bids and begin construction of a new\_Caribbean Port with feasibility studies being conducted during 2017 for a port near Bluefields.\_The Inter-American Development bank has already loaned Nicaragua US$20 million for a pre-feasibility study, and recently loaned another US$87 million for the study itself. Aguerri said\_Nicaraguan companies pay between US$800-$1200 per container extra because of the need to\_ship through ports in Honduras or Costa Rica.\_(El Nuevo Diario, Dec. 16)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Barometer of the Americas, a Latin American-wide Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)\_affiliated to Vanderbilt University, released the results of its Nicaragua survey taken before the\_November presidential election. It confirmed other polls which showed President Daniel Ortega\_enjoyed 69% approval for his handling of the economy. The poll also showed that \"the majority of\_the Nicaraguan people (68%) said the economy of the country and their personal economic\_situation is better or the same as it was twelve months ago.\" That’s up from only 34% who\_agreed in 2006. Sixty-seven percent said the economy was their most important concern while\_only 5% said it was security. Barometer pointed out that security is the top concern in other\_countries in the region. The survey was conducted across the country from September 13 to\_October 19, 2016.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 15; El Nuevo Diario, Dec. 14)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">The Nicaragua National Assembly is poised to approve US$103.3 million for an\_exploration and feasibility study project of geothermal energy generation in the Department of\_Chinandega’s Cosigüina volcano. National Assembly Deputy José Figueroa, member of the\_Production, Economy and Budget Commission, reiterated \"great interest in the promotion of\_public-private investments for the exploration of geothermal energy. There is a huge potential,\_Cosigüina alone has the capacity to generate more than 100 megawatts of energy and there is a\_long volcanic chain on the Pacific side of the country,\" Figueroa said.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 15)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported that\_the Nicaragua economy was the third fastest growing in Latin America and the Caribbean in\_2016. The \"2016 Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean\",\_states that the Nicaragua economy grew 4.8%, surpassed only by Panama (5.2%) and the\_Dominican Republic (6.4%). With respect to Nicaragua the Overview noted that \"robust domestic\_demand had a positive impact in accelerating the creation of formal jobs.\" ECLAC estimates that\_in 2017 the Nicaragua economy will grow 4.7%, driven by private investment as well as\_reactivation of exports, mainly manufacturing.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 15)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Nicaragua ranks 15th in the Global Microscope Report 2016 on financial inclusion in\_more than 50 countries. Conducted by The Economist with support from the Multilateral\_Investment Fund (of the World Bank), the Inter-American Development Bank, the Center for\_Financial Inclusion in Action, and the MetLife Foundation, the report found Nicaragua two points\_higher than the previous year with a score of 55. Report examines the environment for financial\_inclusion, and focused this year on the agreement signed in 2016 between Banpro Grupo\_Promerica, Nicaragua’s largest bank, and ProMujer, a womens micro-credit organization. Banpro\_offers ProMujer’s 46,000 clients a prepaid loan disbursement card, which increases their access\_to credit.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 15)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Nicaragua is a multi-threatened country that, because of its vulnerability, was exposed to\_risks throughout the year, said Abdel García, member of the National Risk Management\_Roundtable (MNGR). From January through November 2016, MNGR counted 86 disaster\_threats. Thirty-three of these events were geological, (earthquakes and volcanic erruptions), 42\_were events associated with the climate (floods and droughts), and 11 were human-caused\_events such as fires, deforestation, migratory crises. “These events affect not only the emotional\_stability of the individual but also their economy well-being and that of the country,” Garcia\_explained.\_(El Nuevo Diario, Dec. 15)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">Representatives of the Central America law enforcement organizations noted that\_Nicaragua is the country with the lowest juvenile delinquency rate in the region. The Nicaragua\_educational model and the creation of job opportunities for at-risk young people are some of the\_factors that have influenced the decline in juvenile offenses in the country. The Nicaragua\_National Police has found that reduction of crime rates in children under the age of 17 is due to\_integrated programs designed for at-risk young people, keeping them from joining criminal\_groups. Construction of new sports facilities has also been a priority of the Nicaraguan\_government to promote healthy entertainment and maintain low juvenile crime rate. At the\_meeting of the Chiefs and Directors of Police of Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and\_Colombia, Nicargua’s Police Chief Aminta Granera was re-elected president of the body. Many of\_Nicaragua’s police reforms have been initiated under her leadership.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 14;\_El Nuevo Diario, Dec. 14)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">The United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF recognized the effectiveness of social\_programs carried out by the Government of Nicaragua in favor of children. The UNICEF\_representative Iván Yerovi said, “It is of great importance to recognize the achievements of\_Nicaragua. We are in favor of these positive results; it is a good time to reiterate our support and\_our decision to align ourselves with these national priorities and to be a reliable partner, a partner\_that can be efficient and effective.” Likewise, the former Special Ombudsman for the Rights of\_Children, Carlos Emilio López, noted the substantial amount of social programs for children\_carried out by the administration of President Daniel Ortega through institutions such as the\_Ministry of Family that contributes to the reduction of the levels of malnutrition, infant mortality,\_adolescent crime, the eradication of child labor and increased vaccination coverage for the\_prevention of diseases.\_(Nicaragua News, Dec. 13)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li class=\"p1\">The Nicaragua National Chamber of Tourism (CANTUR) is estimating that about\_200,000 tourists will arrive in the country in the present month of December, generating about\_US$65 million in revenue. The president of CANTUR, Leonardo Torres, said that 26% of tourists\_visiting Nicaragua come from North America and 8.5% from Europe. He added that\_improvements were made to the airports, such as reducing the amount of paperwork and\_increasing the number of Passport windows. Official data from the International Airport Authority\_states that between January and November of this year 602,710 foreign passengers arrived by\_air, 10,957 more than the same period in 2015, reflecting a 1.85% increase.\_(Nicaragua News,\_Dec. 13)</li>\n</ul>"
