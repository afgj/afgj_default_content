      value: "When the Tear Down the Walls National Gathering ends, just a few blocks away thousands of people will start gathering for the annual All Souls Procession. This will be an exciting opportunity for us in Tucson to share something with the rest of you that truly comes from the collective heart of this city.\r\n\r\nHere\r\n\r\nFor those of you coming from outside of Tucson and Southern Arizona, there are a few things you should remember. First of all, remember that you are an honored guest, invited by Tucson community members who are helping organize this concert. As such, please note that the All Souls Procession is the one time of year that so many Tucsonans gather together, and that it is one of the things that makes our city and its people what we are—that gives us a cross-cultural cohesion as a people. This is not like Burning Man, it's not like the motorcycles in Sturgis, it's not going on tour with the Grateful Dead, it's not Woodstock. This is not a big event where people are recruited to come in from all over the country and all over the world. But it does have a whole lot to do with what it means to be a Tucsonan and honoring our specific milieu of history and peoples. So—welcome, come and join us as guests of the family.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to bear in mind. This is not Hallowe'en. This is not about dressing up as monsters or werewolves or vampires or anything like that. It's not about dressing up in sexy costumes.<strong> People do dress up, but usually as <a href=\"http://gomexico.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/g/calavera.htm\">calaveras</a> or dressing up in a way that remembers those who have passed—that sort of thing. By all means, do join in and remember your own ancestors and departed friends and families.</strong> But put away the monster garb.\r\n\r\nAnother important thing: this is a time to PARTY with the dead and the deceased and with each other, and it's also an all-ages family time. Graphic and violent pictures of those killed in war, by death squads, from nuclear radiation and so on are<strong> NOT APPROPRIATE</strong>. Do you want to make a political statement about those whose lives were taken by drones, by US wars, by police brutality, by border militarization? By all means, these remembrances are to be encouraged. But remember, no matter how tragic or unjust the circumstances have been for those who have passed, we are hear to remember and celebrate the lives that were lived. We honor these by our celebration.\r\n\r\n<b>SOME BACKGROUND:</b>\r\n\r\nTucson is a place with a history that goes back thousands of years. This place was here well before the coming of the Spanish or English speakers, and it is much older than the United States invasion and occupation of this area. In fact, TDTW should know a little more about that history. We'll be meeting at the Tucson Convention Center (TCC). If you go outside the center, and look to your West, you'll see a couple of things. There in the distance is a solitary hill with an “A” on it that is referred to as “A” Mountain or Sentinel Peak. Between that mountain and the TCC is a river called the Santa Cruz. Unless an unusually heavy rain occurs, the river will probably be a dry bed filled with sand and no water.\r\n\r\nHowever, until 100 years ago, that river ran year round and with enough water in it that a steam boat for tourists used to maintain a regular route between Nogales, 60 miles to the South, and Tucson. Even 50 years ago, the river still flowed year round and locals were able to fish in the stream. What happened? Well...what happened was a profound immigration problem, the worst and most devastating this area has ever seen. Around the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, English speaking soldiers, occupiers and settlers started coming into this area, fighting wars against indigenous peoples and against Mexico. Through violence, swindles and political and economic domination, they stole this land away and subjugated the ecosystems with unsustainable military forts and industries, cattle ranching, big agribusinesses and a settler population. What resulted was that grasslands turned to deserts and rivers turned to dust. So that's why the Santa Cruz river is dry today.\r\n\r\nBut for most its existence, the river ran. The Santa Cruz provided water and fertile soil. And overlooking the Santa Cruz was a Black Seated Mountain that stood out from and in front of the other hills of the Tucson Mountains—the very same Sentinel Peak/A Mountain. From that hill, one could look out in all directions to see the movements of game animals or enemies on the attack. The combination of security, water and rich soil means that the area between Sentinel Peak and the Santa Cruz River has the distinction of being perhaps the longest continually inhabited and cultivated area in the United States. Archaeological evidence has been found that dates back 4,000 years and many authorities believe the human presence may go back as many as 12,000 years. This area is called Chuk Shon, the original name that “Tucson” is taken from. The name of the area can be interpreted both to refer to the “Black seated mountain”, but it can also refer to the history and the ancestors who have gone before.\r\n\r\nChuk Shon, the Santa Cruz and the nearby lands are also where the Spanish first established their missions and forts. Therefore Chuk Shon also holds distinction as being the local and regional birthplace of the Mexican and Chicano peoples.\r\n\r\nSo let's come back to the TCC, where the National Gathering is being held. In more modern history, this area was home to the oldest barrio in the city. It was a place where families had lived for generations, with a rich and vibrant culture, full of homes, stores, theaters and music. But in 1971, the Tucson Convention Center and neighboring La Placita were built in a spasm of so-called urban renewal that displaced thousands and destroyed the community and family homes that once filled this area and gave the city its heart. Please be ever mindful of this, of the ghosts who walk among us, as we meet together for this conference. For many of us, we long for a day, when we build that new and better world for which we hope and work for, that places like the land now occupied by the TCC and La Placita will be replaced by the return of the communities that rightfully belong there....\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, Chuk Shon aka Tucson has become a place where a number of cultural traditions have mixed. But it is important to remember that this place is at its heart, an indigenous, a Mexican and a Chicano city. For the rest of us, we live and visit here at the mercy of these ancestors and their descendants. We have come as interlopers. At the very least, we must show our respects and give our alliances to the original inhabitants and their struggles for transformation and liberation.\r\n\r\nSo—back to the All Souls Procession. Pardon the little diversion into history—but, really, it is a necessary background for understanding what this weekend means. Of course, the All Souls Procession is a modern phenomenon. The Dias de los Muertos is the real holiday. This is a celebration and time of remembering that has its roots in ancient practices of indigenous people and that has mixed, syncretically, with Catholic and Spanish traditions. The Dias de los Muertos date back to Aztec ceremonies honoring Mictecacihuatl, the Goddess of the Underworld, ruling there with her husband Mictlantecuhtli. Another point of history is that Aztlan, the original home of the peoples who would migrate to the Valley of Mexico and establish the Aztec empire, has been identified by many as including the area where Tucson is located. The native people to this specific area, the Tohono and Akimel 'O'odham speak a Uto-Aztecan language, which indicates linguistic links.\r\n\r\nMarigolds--the Aztec flower associated with the dead, sugar skulls and skeletons enjoying the pleasures of living—laughing, dancing, eating and drinking—are common symbols of the season. The days are observed on November 1 and 2. On the first, the focus is on children who have died, and on the 2<sup>nd</sup>, the adults get to join in!\r\n\r\nThere are many traditions and meanings to these festivities. Some hope that the souls of the dead may be entreated to intervene or intercede on behalf of the living. But above all, the most central aspect of all is the shrine. Shrines are built to remember specific persons who have passed, and can include pictures and other mementos. But central to the idea of the Dias de los Muertos is the idea that the souls of the dead return for a day or two of partying with the living, who pay them honor. This is why shrines will often include things that those passed enjoyed during their sojourn among us: musical instruments, a bottle of tequila, tobacco, cakes and tamales and pastries—all kinds of things.\r\n\r\nThis is not a time of mourning. Whether we believe in an after-life, in souls, in spirits or not, all of us who have lost a loved one know that we carry the very real memories and, indeed, tracks of the departed within us all the time. The dead never really leave us—they are part of who we are. So the Dias de los Muertos is not a time for mourning but of celebration! Yes, it is all about respect and there are always aspects of solemnity. But while we may focus on grief at the funeral, during this time, we focus on the presence of the dead who still very much make up so much about who we the living are as individuals, as families, as communities.\r\n\r\nThe All Souls Procession is not the Dias de los Muertos, although it very much is inspired and connected to that history. But the All Souls Procession began a few years back—its a modern tradition, not an ancient one. It has its roots in Dia de Los Muertos shrines that were funded by the City of Tucson. Chicano artist Alex Rodriquez was one of the people to receive this funding and start reaching out to the broad community for participation. The actual procession began with a small parade that was organized in the early 90s by Tucson artist Susan Johnson, whose father had recently died. The parade is the first Sunday in November, and usually falls after the actual Dias de los Muertos, both honoring those days but also setting itself apart as different and distinct, so as not to coopt these ancient traditions nor dishonor the cultures they come from.\r\n\r\nIf I may add a personal note regarding these first years of Susan's parade and Alex' shrines.... I was a part of the local Punk scene back then. There was a very difficult time over a short period of years in which a number of that scene died a series of sudden and unexpected deaths from a variety of causes—negligent medical treatment, drug overdoses, suicides, accidents, heart attacks. This all happened before and during the first years of the Procession, and thus became very important to that scene. We suddenly became very aware of our own mortality and we missed our friends.\r\n\r\nSo those first events in those first years were truly a rag-tag mix of people from several different communities, but all united in both the processing of grief and the remembrance and celebration of lives we had held so dear.\r\n\r\nAnd it caught on. The All Souls Procession started growing and growing and growing so that this coming November 3<sup>rd</sup>, when the procession takes place, you'll see thousands of people taking to the streets to remember...and to party. Please join us.\r\n\r\nI'll see you at the procession!"
