Our Government provided the facilities to the Commission to carry out their work freely. We provided the information they requested and ensured meetings with the authorities, and attended to all their requests.\r\n\r\nOn <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1532322233\"><span class=\"aQJ\">May 21</span></span>, the IACHR issued a report with preliminary observations and recommendations, based on audiovisual information and testimonies edited and manipulated by the authors and executors of the attempted coup, giving full credibility to them, without allowing the Nicaraguan Government the possibility to contest such unfounded assertions.\r\n\r\nDespite the frankness and openness with which our Government assisted the IACHR and the abundant evidence and information provided, which proved the violent nature of terrorist actions by the coup groups such as hate crimes, torture, killings, murders, destruction and burning of offices and public\_institutions, these crimes were not reflected in the report, which in and of itself, shows their bias.\r\n\r\nThe IACHR manipulated the information, converting an attempted coup into an alleged peaceful protest, deliberately omitting that the murdered persons are mostly police officers, State officials, Sandinista militants and civilians unrelated to the conflict, whose causes of death were from injuries with firearms caused by the coup plotters.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary report repeated and spread the lies of the authors, actors and executors of the Coup d’état attempt. This contributed to the massive use of platforms and social networks for the media and psychological manipulation that incited violence, all for the sole purpose of justifying the illegal acts and crimes aimed at breaking the constitutional order with the international community.\r\n\r\nThe IACHR deliberately omits the truth that does not suit the interests of those from abroad who sponsor actions aimed at overthrowing the constitutional government of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, our Government, expressing its vocation for peace and acting in good faith, accepted and initiated the implementation of the recommendations of the IACHR and responded to the requests of the so-called representatives of the civil society of the opposition and the Episcopal Conference, in the framework of the National Dialogue Table. One request was to take the National Police off the streets and we did that. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the General Secretariat of the OAS and the European Union were invited; the integration of the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts was agreed on to help and support the investigations initiated by the State of Nicaragua. At the same time, the coup groups hardened their actions with more roadblocks, murders, kidnappings, torture with cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; hate crimes and burning of private and public buildings and vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe same happened with the Final Report that the IACHR presented before the Permanent Council of the OAS. Our Government informed and documented the IACHR in a timely manner about each act of violence committed by the coup leaders. The IACHR was obliged to make some reference to the opposition violence in response to the complaints of our Government.\r\n\r\nThe IACHR in its reports has used incomplete and biased criteria, intentionally avoiding expressing opinions and conclusions when dealing with acts of violence and crimes executed by \"peaceful\" protesters.\r\n\r\nAn example of the above is that during the existence of the roadblocks, terrorist acts were committed: People were burned alive; government supporters were humiliated and tortured; hundreds of Central American transporters were held hostage; and the civilian population was unable to leave their homes freely and work.\r\n\r\nOn these crimes, there was no pronouncement from the IACHR condemning them, denouncing them or expressing concern despite the fact that they had verified it personally in situ; seeking to legitimize these types of illegal acts.\r\n\r\nThe reports and communications from the IACHR on Nicaragua are questionable in themselves, because of their political bias and work methodology, which lacks all scientific rigor. One of their most notorious failures being the lack of verification of the information received and the irresponsible use of sources with no credibility.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the IACHR, in conjunction with the Government of the United States and other countries, promote interventionist political maneuvers, attempting to destabilize and isolate Nicaragua internationally in order to overthrow its Constitutional Government.\r\n\r\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights distorts and delegitimizes its activity and that of its officials by assuming political positions, in open contravention of the OAS Charter, the Regulations and the Statute of the IACHR itself.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nicaragua demand the IACHR stop their participation in the political and media campaign of lies, misrepresentation, qualification and stigmatization against the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity.
