Two fundamental tasks of any revolution are: political formation of the population with and for which the process of change is made, and preparing from the first moment the defense of that process, of that revolution.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/what-the-coup-against-evo-morales-means-to-indigenous-people-like-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/what-the-coup-against-evo-morales-means-to-indigenous-people-like-me&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573933579637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGp5VtrODCGbMGJwZuYC3ynyaF_EA\">Nick Estes: What the coup against Evo Morales means to indigenous people like me</a> Evo Morales is more than Bolivia’s first indigenous president — he is our president, too. The rise of a humble Aymara coca farmer to the nation’s highest office in 2006 marked the arrival of indigenous people as vanguards of history. Evo represents five centuries of indigenous deprivation and struggle in the hemisphere. A coup against Evo, therefore, is a coup against indigenous people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/11/12/bolivia-and-venezuela-two-countries-but-same-hybrid-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/11/12/bolivia-and-venezuela-two-countries-but-same-hybrid-war/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573933579637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMJMGmybo4ThsBpO8UuxUzV9A5QQ\">Bolivia and Venezuela: Two Countries, But Same Hybrid War</a> The Hybrid War includes the creation of violent groups with a “moderate” façade, but the circumstances in Venezuela have been different and harder to succeed in regime change.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Venezuela has developed a strong civic-military union supported by thousands of voluntary militias that has been the bastion against which the Hybrid War has failed despite the numerous attempts to break that union. The National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela have a strict abidance to the Venezuelan constitution and have not betrayed the Bolivarian Revolution in the 20 years of its existence, making it impossible for the final act of the Hybrid War to take place.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://fair.org/home/the-bolivian-coup-is-not-a-coup-because-us-wanted-it-to-happen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fair.org/home/the-bolivian-coup-is-not-a-coup-because-us-wanted-it-to-happen/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573933579637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxr4C9ZsJHmHgdSbh-QHy2wLd90Q\">The Bolivian Coup Is Not a Coup—Because US Wanted It to Happen</a> The corporate media pretend the coup is not a coup, just as they also pretend there was fraud in the election vote. The media message from the Bolivia case is clear: A coup is not a coup if we like the outcome.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bolivia coup led by Christian fascist paramilitary leader and millionaire – with foreign support.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/bolivia-created-over-four-thousand-accounts-to-legitimize-coup-20191113-0011.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/bolivia-created-over-four-thousand-accounts-to-legitimize-coup-20191113-0011.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573933579637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjb6CXnEjrq94Yo3Vtjk6cZ8JRQQ\">Social Media Use in Justifying the Coup: Over 4000 Twitter Accounts Created to Legitimize Coup</a>\_ It becomes more clear the role of social media as yet another political party able to legitimize or remove any Government, especially through social networks. A few days after the consummated coup against Bolivian President Evo Morales, there have been more than 4500 new Twitter accounts created, without almost any followers, with the hashtag #BoliviaNoHayGolpe installed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Bolivian-Senates-Leader-Attacked-By-Police-and-Coup-Supporters-20191113-0009.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Bolivian-Senates-Leader-Attacked-By-Police-and-Coup-Supporters-20191113-0009.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573933579637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFN11VhNaxpYCZsGEUrHfFgvrKjqQ\">Bolivian MAS Senate Leader Assaulted By Police and Coup Supporters</a> The legitimate President of the Senate, Adriana Salvatierra, was assaulted by the police as she was trying to enter the Senate on Wednesday in order to comply with the constitutional rule that automatically proclaims the head of the upper chamber the Interim President when the President steps down, after Evo Morales was forced to resign on Sunday.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/11/11/bolivia-coup-fascist-foreign-support-fernando-camacho/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thegrayzone.com/2019/11/11/bolivia-coup-fascist-foreign-support-fernando-camacho/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573933579637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5U84cE8kLYayife_2j-xpSQ1LEA\">Max Blumenthal and Ben Norton: Bolivia coup led by Christian fascist paramilitary leader and millionaire – with foreign support</a> Bolivian coup leader Luis Fernando Camacho is a far-right multi-millionaire who arose from fascist movements in the Santa Cruz region, where the US has encouraged separatism.
