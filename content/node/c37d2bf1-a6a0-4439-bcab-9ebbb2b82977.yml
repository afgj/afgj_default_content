It opened\_earlier, playing at the mall in Managua. Never being one to pass\_up air-conditioning, I went, munched popcorn and thoroughly\_enjoyed it, as did the Nicaraguan audience that filled the theater.\_Their laughter was a couple of seconds delayed because they\_were reading subtitles, but it was loud and enthusiastic.\_“American Made” is about gun running, drug trafficking, money\_laundering and dirty deeds in general out of the CIA and the\_White House during the Reagan administration. Much of it takes\_place in Nicaragua, although apparently the Nicaraguan\_locations were actually filmed in\_<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3532216/locations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Columbia.</a>\n\nIn order to enjoy this movie, you will need to adjust your\_expectations in two ways. First, you’ll have to accept that farce is\_the correct genre for portraying the Reagan era, the illegal\_Contra War, and the war on drugs. If you’re more of a Truthout\_kind of person and you don’t think imperialism is a laughing\_matter, you may want to pass on this flick. However, I would\_argue that the sequences of scenes that leads into a news clip of\_Nancy Reagan declaring the administration’s drug policy to be\_“Just Say No!” Is comic gold and not to be missed.\n\nThe second mental adjustment needed before seeing “American\_Made” is to recognize that not a word of it is true. This\_comedy/adventure yarn is laid over real events, the chronology\_matches more or less, and the characters share names with real\_people (Barry Seal, Pablo Escobar, Oliver North, etc.) but the\_places where the movie and reality are congruent are\_nonexistent. The character Tom Cruise creates is sexy, athletic,\_hyperkinetic, easily bored, not too bright, disinclined to think\_through anything, generous, and, despite his many crimes, a\_likable guy. For my money, it is an excellent job of acting.\_However, there is no reason to think the real Barry Seal was any\_of these things. On the other hand, you can put money on the\_real Seal’s life being more violent, scummier, uglier, scarier,\_meaner, and way less entertaining than the one led by Tom\_Cruise on the screen.\n\nSimilarly, off the mark is the movie’s unambiguous presentation\_of the Sandinistas having a direct hand in Pablo Escobar’s\_trafficking of drugs out of Nicaragua in the 80s. This sequence\_concerns a White House sting operation, totally illegal and\_unethical in and of itself, to get photos that would prove the\_government of Nicaragua was directly assisting Escobar’s\_operation. Much was made of these photos by the Reagan\_administration, but in fact they proved nothing and were at best\_inconclusive. “Wall Street Journal reporter\_Jonathan Kwitny\_threw\_doubt over Seal’s accusations, claiming there was no evidence\_tying any Nicaraguan officials to the drug shipment.”\n\nOn the other hand there is no question that the US-backed\_Contras and their CIA handlers were up to their armpits in the\_cocaine trafficking. The documentation of their involvement in\_introducing crack cocaine to Los Angeles isn't even disputed.\_That crime led to an epidemic in the US that devastated political\_organizing in the inner cities and cost urban African Americans a\_whole generation. Along the same lines, the movie ends with\_assassins sent by the Columbians killing Seal. However, people\_who have looked closely at the story conclude that it is just as\_likely that\_the hit\_was ordered and orchestrated by the CIA, The\_White House, and/or the Bush family.\n\nIn watching this movie, it is important to remember and to tell\_others, that Nicaragua has not suffered from the effects of drug\_trafficking that have devastated most of Central America. In\_contrast to the northern triangle countries of Honduras, El\_Salvador, and Guatemala, with their close affiliation with the US,\_Nicaragua is safe and secure. President Daniel Ortega is\_personally so anti-drug, that he joins with the US in blocking any\_discussion of decriminalization of even marijuana in Latin\_American and international forums. The Nicaraguan police and\_military are the least corrupt in Central America and among the\_least corrupt in the world.\n\nI say, go to the local megaplex, buy a ticket and some popcorn,\_fasten your seatbelt, enjoy the action and the laughs, get a peek\_at Tom Cruise’s butt (twice!), appreciate “American Made” for\_what it is, a Hollywood action comedy flick, and don’t believe a\_word of it. Then go home and read any of the well written\_exposes of the Iran/Contra war and the dirty dealings in the\_Reagan White House. For example:\n\n<a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=ck9CeIeqKyFvOGQkbqKetHoL1wl%2BEn6r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iran-Contra: Reagan's Scandal and the Unchecked Abuse of\_Presidential Power by Malcolm Byrne</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Firewall-Iran-Contra-Conspiracy-Lawrence-Walsh/dp/0393318605\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Firewall: The Iran-Contra Conspiracy and Cover-up by Lawrence\_E.

That should be a\_fact checker’s nightmare.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>BRIEFS</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The US House of Representatives passed the NICA Act on October\_3 by unanimous consent without a voice vote. The Act, which if it passes the\_Senate and is signed by the president, will require officials representing the\_US on international lending institution boards to vote no on multilateral loans\_to Nicaragua. The vote was characterized by one Representative as a\_“retirement gift” to far right Miami Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The Nicaraguan government condemned the bill. “This bill is a\_flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan people and a denial\_of all political, social, cultural and economic processes undertaken to\_promote peace, security and the well-being of all Nicaraguans,” the\_government statement said. (Nicaragua News, Oct. 4)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>President of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP)\_José Adan Aguerri said the Tripartite Alliance Model between government,\_employers and labor has strengthened competitiveness and helped to\_improve the investment climate in the country. \"During the last three years\_Nicaragua has climbed 15 positions in the World Economic Forum Global\_Competitiveness Index confirming the political stability, legal certainty and\_sound macroeconomic management of the country,\" Aguerri said.\_(Nicaragua News, Sept. 29)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Formal employment grew 7.8% in August over the previous year\_according to the Central Bank. The report also noted that a total of 919,724\_workers are enrolled in social security, which is the definition of formal\_employment. Sectors such as commerce, services, hotels and restaurants\_are among the main drivers of this growth in formal employment. (Nicaragua\_News, Sept. 29)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The Central Bank also announced that exports totaled US$1.6\_billion during the first seven months of this year, 21.8% above the same\_period in 2016. Sectors such as agricultural production (26.8%),\_manufacturing (24.1%) and fisheries (17.7%) were among the main drivers\_of this growth. (Nicaragua News, Sept. 28)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The Organization of American States (OAS) confirmed on Sept. 26 that\_an Electoral Observer Mission will arrive in Managua on\_October 10\_to\_accompany the Nicaragua\_November 5\_municipal elections. The press release\_stated that the Electoral Mission of 60 observers led by Dr. Wilfredo Penco,\_vice president of the Uruguay Electoral Council, will ensure a wide presence\_throughout the country consistent with established requirements to obtain a\_statistically representative sample of the polling places. (Nicaragua News,\_Sept. 27)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Central Bank President Ovidio Reyes announced that the government\_will present a reform to the Low-Cost Housing Law (ACT 677) and the Urban\_and Rural Housing Institute (Law 428) to the National Assembly in the coming\_days. \"The purpose of these reforms is to increase the financing ceiling for low\_cost housing from US$32 thousand to US$50 thousand. The reforms will also\_provide greater access to subsidies for the building or repair of housing, going\_from US$23,000 to US$30,000,” the Central Bank President said. (Nicaragua\_News, Sept. 27)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A report by the Italian Tourism Agency, Tour 2000, states that\_Nicaragua was awarded the Cultural Tourism Prize, which is granted yearly by\_the Italian government and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\_Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Aspects such as sustainable development,\_community participation, cultural promotion and protection of World Heritage\_sites are among the parameters evaluated by UNESCO for the granting of this\_prestigious distinction. (Nicaragua News, Sept. 26)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>HKND, the Chinese company with the concession to build the\_proposed inter-oceanic canal across Nicaragua, reported that it will conduct a\_massive reforestation project. HKND had hired the international company\_ERM to conduct the required Environmental Impact Study. ERM which states\_that without appropriate measures, the current ecological trend in Nicaragua\_“is not positive from any point of view.” The report stated, “Without adequate\_measures, most of the forests existing in the country will disappear within10 to\_15 years.” HKND also announced that it now plans to move both the Western\_and Eastern locks inland so as to protect them from hurricane storm surge as\_well as to better protect against salination of Lake Cocibolca and to have less\_impact on the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and the Booby Key marine\_reserve.
