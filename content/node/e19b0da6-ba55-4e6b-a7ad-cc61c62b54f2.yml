In the face of these poll numbers it is hard to maintain any credibility for the opposition and corporate media narrative that says Ortega is a dictator, the police are repressing the people, and that Nicaragua is collapsing into a failed state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://orinocotribune.com/nicaragua-has-built-130-thousand-new-houses-in-12-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orinocotribune.com/nicaragua-has-built-130-thousand-new-houses-in-12-years/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579975756103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_6FDPh12jTMlsUlL429PMtEbS-g\">Orinoco Tribune: Nicaragua Has Built 130 Thousand New Houses in 12 Years</a> In 2020, four housing fairs will be held jointly with private companies, in addition the construction plan of 50 thousand new houses for the next 5 years in Nicaragua will begin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.coha.org/the-other-nicaragua-empire-and-resistance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.coha.org/the-other-nicaragua-empire-and-resistance/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579975756103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGhEl6Wzhy8TBaSdo0CKdN5Cb5XpA\">COHA: Nicaragua, Empire and Resistance</a> The version in the US, repeated by human rights organizations and private media from Managua to Washington, describes an almost complete “dictatorship” that, when faced with citizen protesters, responded with waves of violent repression aimed primarily at students and journalists, leaving hundreds of peaceful protesters dead.This article seeks to disprove that tale about events in Nicaragua in 2018, which, although meticulously constructed, is a fabrication made a priori by the National Endowment for Democracy’s regime change laboratory, along with other U.S. institutions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes-the-revolution-has-transformed-the-lives-of-nicaraguas-caribbean-peoples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://afgj.org/nicanotes-the-revolution-has-transformed-the-lives-of-nicaraguas-caribbean-peoples&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579975756103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE37-VJAfj3Xo0ih95qsAGCjc30lw\">NicaNotes: The Revolution has transformed the lives of Nicaragua’s Caribbean peoples</a> One of the historical achievements in this period is that the Ortega administration has managed to unite the Pacific with the Caribbean after years of isolation, incorporating into national development abandoned indigenous communities faced with the structural poverty of centuries, a historical social debt. This Sandinista government has invested more resources for development and infrastructure in the Caribbean than any other, $1.1217 billion 2007-19, compared to $202 million from 1990-2007.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes-nicaraguas-message-at-the-cop-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://afgj.org/nicanotes-nicaraguas-message-at-the-cop-25&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579975756103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHOKXuNyUHM5zCWpRE5efxH8U8Pw\">NicaNotes: Nicaragua’s message to the UN Climate Change Conference</a> Ten countries account for 72% of the total world emissions.
