However, it has affected\_me very strongly and I believe it has significant repercussions for Nicaragua,\_for The United\_States, and for the volunteers.\r\n\r\nMy wife, Deborah Drew, and I came to Nicaragua as Peace Corps\_volunteers in 2015 and did our two years of service in Chinandega, Chinandega.\_(Yes! Its\_reputation as the hottest place in Nicaragua is well deserved.) This\_was our second time as volunteers. Ten years earlier, 2005-2007, we lived and\_worked in\_Sonaguera, Honduras. My claim to fame is that I have been the oldest\_Peace Corps volunteer in two countries. I turned 60 in Honduras and 70 in\_Nicaragua.\_Most people apply right out of college. The average age of\_volunteers is 28. In contrast, Deb and I have spent a sizable part of our\_retirement living in Central\_America through the Peace Corps. We continue to\_live in Nicaragua, in Managua now, because Deb works for Peace Corps as a nurse\_in the medical office that\_takes care of the volunteers. If circumstances\_allow, we hope to live in Managua for a couple of more years.\r\n\r\nPeace Corps also pulled out of Honduras. They left in 2012 when a\_volunteer got caught in a crossfire on a public bus and got shot in the leg. At\_the time\_everyone was aware that the violence in the country was escalating\_rapidly. It was well on its way to being declared the most dangerous country in\_the world due\_to drug violence and political oppression. Of course, things only\_worsened and the volunteers have never returned. The situation in Nicaragua is\_really not\_comparable to what happened in Honduras. The violence there is so\_endemic to all the institutions of the country that the path to a more peaceful\_future is hard to\_envision. In Nicaragua, as tragic as it is, the situation\_appears to be transitory and there is much hope for the future.\r\nOK… first things first. I am not with the CIA. I kind of like the\_teasing I get about that, because physically, emotionally and politically I’m\_the most improbable CIA\_agent in the world. Further, I’m convinced, there is no\_truth to those rumors. With that out of the way, I am deeply committed to Peace\_Corps and believe there is\_no better use of American tax dollars. I’d put the\_benefits of the face-to-face diplomacy and neighborliness of the Peace Corps\_model up against anything the\_State Department, and certainly the military, is\_doing. In the two countries where I served there are people who remember the\_old gringo who…\r\n\r\nleft his children and grandchildren in the US for two years and\_lived in our neighborhood,\r\n\r\ntaught the school student leaders about HIV/ADS, including how to\_use a condom and supervised us to pass the information on to our school mates,\r\n\r\ntold me I had talent, gave me materials, and encouraged me to\_make paintings,\r\n\r\ntook my little brother for an operation so he could learn to walk\_when he was 5 years old,\r\n\r\nspoke bad Spanish, but wanted to talk about everything,\r\n\r\ntook me and my friends to the circus for my 12th birthday,\r\n\r\ngot his accountant in the US to give me a scholarship so I could\_go to college,\r\n\r\nwhen my brother died of AIDS, painted a mural for our church in\_his honor,\r\n\r\nlet me stay in his house when I didn’t have a place to live\_during college,\r\n\r\nwas curious about our culture and took classes to learn about it.\r\n\r\nI guess there is the chance that this comes off as blowing my own\_horn. I’m just going to trust that people will know that’s not what it is\_about. Until April 23, there\_were 160 people from the US, mostly young, who had\_stories of their individual contact with Nicaraguans equal to mine. My claim is\_that the cumulative impact of\_this goodwill is not to be underestimated. It is\_my claim that it can do more for the image of the US on foreign soil, at a\_pittance, than any formal diplomatic\_mission can achieve. It is not good for\_the United States to take Peace Corps volunteers out of a country, because it\_removes the human face of who we are as a\_people and reduces our presence to what\_goes on behind the fortress-like walls of the embassy. These are times in which\_it is particularly important for our\_country to put our self forward, in the\_communities, in the schools, in the health centers, on the farms, and say, here\_is an example of what people from the US\_are like and we want to be good\_neighbors. This is the essence of what Peace Corps does.\r\n\r\nThe conflicts that lead to the evacuation of the Peace Corps\_volunteers started on Monday, April 16 with the announcement of reductions to\_social security\_payments. They escalated and spread into the weekend and that\_was when the embassy announced that they were sending non-essential personnel\_and\_families home. This was quickly followed by a decision that all the\_volunteers would have to leave the country. They were first told to “stand\_fast” - Peace Corps\_lingo for don’t leave your community, then to\_“consolidate”. Over Monday and Tuesday everyone was transported to Granada and\_put up at The Hotel Granada.\_\_At 4:00 AM\_Wednesday morning, four Tica buses arrived to transport the volunteers and the\_staff accompanying them to San Jose, Costa Rica. They were met\_there by staff\_from Washington headquarters and Peace Corps Costa Rica and the process began\_of putting them all on administrative leave and booking their\_flights back to\_their home of record in the United States. In a very rapid sequence of events,\_the volunteers’ lives were completely reshuffled. They were\_reassured by\_everyone that the return to the States was temporary and that they’d be back in\_thirty days. Some took the attitude that this was nothing more than\_an all-expenses\_paid vacation and their plans would be resumed quickly, pretty much where they\_left off. Others were more distressed about all they were leaving\_behind,\_including incomplete projects, host families, friends, romantic partners, at\_least one spouse, and assorted pets. I think it is clear that the evacuation\_was\_an emotional rollercoaster ride for everyone and plenty of emotion got\_expressed; sadness, disappointment, confusion, anger, disbelief, etc. By the\_first of May,\_they had all gotten on their flights and gone home. This is a\_pretty remarkable group of people. To a greater than average degree, they are\_bright, motivated,\_adaptable, and well intentioned. In the long run they’ll be\_fine. They know or will learn that, with a certain amount of privilege, even\_the most stressful events\_eventually make a good story. Nonetheless, this\_disruption to their lives is one more cost of the turmoil in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nI live in Reparto San Juan in Managua. The Peace Corps office is\_barely two blocks from my house. It is a moderately upscale neighborhood, close\_to the\_Universidad Centroamericana\_(UCA)\_de Nicaragua\_and the Masaya highway, two centers of the protests. There are several\_small hotels and hostels in the area\_and a strip of popular bars and\_restaurants.\_\_All around me I can see the\_economic impact of the unrest and the volunteers leaving. Peace Corps probably\_constitute half the business of the hotels, taxi drivers, restaurants and bars\_around here. Now, these establishments are pretty much empty. In the\_communities\_where they live and work Peace Corps volunteers get and spend a\_monthly stipend of about $300. Many supplement this with savings and money from\_home.\_They pay rent, buy food and clothes, travel, and consume more than their\_share of Toñas. Often family and friends come to visit and spend more. Just in\_terms of\_what the volunteers spend out of their pockets, I think it is a safe\_to estimate that their evacuation is going to cost the Nicaraguan economy more\_than $50,000.00\_dollars for every month they are gone. A couple of weeks age,\_NicaNotes\_reported, “Economist Nestor\_Avendaño predicts that\_the economic impact of the\_protests with their violence, deaths, injuries and\_property damage will begin to be felt in the latter half of the year but will\_hit hardest in 2019. He said the\_perception of greater risk and uncertainty\_will lower growth in the Gross National Product from the projected 4.7% to 3.2%\_and will affect every sector of the\_economy except mining. The exit of Peace\_Corps is one small example of how this economic impact will come about.\r\n\r\nThe situation in\_Nicaragua is very complicated. However, there is a tendency to try and avoid\_the complexity and reduce the narrative to \"I'm right and you’re\_wrong\" or \"We are the good guys and you are the bad guys.\" In\_this polarization, people choose their side and try to shape the narrative.\_They only put forward\_information that supports their point of view and\_disregard anything that could possibly support a different perspective. They\_also vilify people who disagree with\_them and declare that everything they say\_is lies. People from the US recognize this, right? It is exactly what is\_happening in our country.\r\n\r\nIt is worth\_asking if the US has chosen a side and is it acting to shape the narrative into\_a single story. While we can differ on how important or how nefarious the\_US\_role in this process has been, I think it is incontestable that the US is anti-Sandinista\_and anti-Ortegista. Therefore, you have got to wonder if there is some\_way in\_which the exit of Peace Corps is part of the shaping of the narrative.\_Certainly the image of Nicaragua as a place that is too dangerous for\_idealistic, young\_North Americans to do humanitarian work is more consistent\_with the State Department’s hostile and aggressive policies than is the image\_of 160 volunteers\_invited by the government of Nicaragua to live and work throughout\_the country augmenting efforts to improve the schools and health care system,\_protect the\_environment, and promote bilingualism. I know the people on the\_ground in Peace Corps Nicaragua and I’m totally convinced of their sincerity\_when they say they\_want the volunteers back as soon as possible and they want\_the program up and running. I do not know the people in Washington, DC. It is\_not out of the\_question, or even unlikely, that Senator Ted Cruz, Republican\_from Texas, will call whoever he calls in the Trump administration and say, “This\_is our chance to\_pass the NicaAct! The worse things look, the better the\_chance. Starting up Peace Corps again sends the wrong message.” Then that\_person calls up Jody\_Olsen, the director of Peace Corps. Jody is by all reports\_a really good person, but she is a Trump appointee. On the phone from the Trump\_administration she\_hears, “Yeah. We are going to take our time on returning\_volunteers to Nicaragua. Better safe than sorry, you know!”\r\n\r\nAs always, it is\_important for people from the US to give their attention to the ways the crisis\_is being used and shaped, to justify US intervention, specifically\_passage of\_the NICA Act. Nicaraguans are perfectly capable, even in crises, of resolving\_their own problems. The last thing they need is intervention from the US.\r\n\r\nBack to those\_rumors about Peace Corps volunteers being CIA agents, not true! However, when\_the movie is made I’d like to be played by Tom Cruise… or\_maybe The Rock… no\_Tom Cruise.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>Briefs</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>The\_representatives of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) who have\_been on an mission in Nicaragua to investigate the current crisis released\_their\_preliminary report on May 21st. [You can read the report in\_Spanish here:\_<a href=\"http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2018/113.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2018/113.asp</a>]They said that there had been 76 deaths\_in the recent protests; 438 people were detained by the authorities with three\_remaining in jail. The national dialogue chaired by the Catholic Bishops\_Conference released a\_communique at the end of yesterday’s meeting which stated\_that the participants agreed to accept the 15 recommendations made by the\_IAHRC. Dialogue participants agreed to\_the appointment of a commission to\_follow up on the recommendations and on a second visit by the IAHRC. However,\_there was no agreement on a proposal made by the\_representatives of small and\_medium businesses (CONIMIPYME) that all road blocks be lifted to permit free\_movement of vehicles. After long debates, opposition members\_continued to\_insist on the resignation of the entire government and the appointment of a\_transition junta. (Informe Pastran, May 21)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Central Bank\_President Ovidio Reyes said that expectations for the growth of Nicaragua’s\_economy this year have been lowered from between 4.5% and 5% to between 3% and\_3.5%. Leonardo Torres, president of the Nicaraguan Council of Micro, Small, and\_Medium Businesses (CONIMIPYME), said that the government had had a “honeymoon”\_with\_big businesses and should now change its policy for similar model of\_dialogue and consensus with small and medium businesses which, he noted “are\_80% of the economy, those\_who truly move the economy” and which have not received\_the same benefits. (Informe Pastran, May 21)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Luis Almagro,\_Secretary General of the Organization of American States, said that in\_Nicaragua there is a climate of negotiation, with the participation of the OAS,\_that has made\_concrete advances for the next presidential elections which will\_have all the guarantees that the opposition and civil society have demanded. He\_added that OAS representatives\_are in permanent contact with the government,\_the Church, businesspeople, and representatives of the opposition. At a forum\_on democracy at George Washington University in\_Washington, DC, he said to\_representatives of civil society who accused him of being an accomplice of\_dictatorship that he was an accomplice in seeking a transparent and just\_electoral process and that there were opposition members who did not respect\_democratic process. A high-level mission of the OAS that has worked with the\_government on\_election reform arrived in Nicaragua on May 22. (Informe Pastran,\_May 21, 22)</li>\r\n</ul>"
