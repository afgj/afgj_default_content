It is especially appropriate that those of us who live in the United States sign, given that our taxes are paying for police militarization and prison construction throughout Mexico. Taking this action shows that we oppose\_U.S. policies that harm our neighbors to the south. President-elect Lopez Obrador has indicated he may be willing to enact the kinds of reforms the Comité Cerezo is asking for: the convening of truth commissions; amnesty for political prisoners; and protection for journalists and human rights defenders. However, neoliberals and the Mexican oligarchy\_are\_mobilizing their own pressure against the letter's goals, and the administration may also well\_be vulnerable. Add your voice to this call for real change!</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: normal; clear: both; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #980000; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;\" href=\"https://default.salsalabs.org/T806764a2-ed22-4571-a39d-619dbb167f6b/33d01b38-8bbc-4241-987f-47dbf19f474a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://default.salsalabs.org/T806764a2-ed22-4571-a39d-619dbb167f6b/33d01b38-8bbc-4241-987f-47dbf19f474a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537248496589000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP53_TnhKrMMF5AKAE0-WMnZ0kYQ\">Click here to sign the open letter</a></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: normal; clear: both; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #980000; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;\" href=\"https://default.salsalabs.org/T531d2935-9559-4529-a498-050220cf4aef/33d01b38-8bbc-4241-987f-47dbf19f474a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://default.salsalabs.org/T531d2935-9559-4529-a498-050220cf4aef/33d01b38-8bbc-4241-987f-47dbf19f474a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537248496589000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoMNXx2uD83cV3SOKsNMJca-Tlyg\">Click here to read the letter in its original Spanish</a></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: normal; clear: both; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em;\"><a style=\"color: #980000; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;\" href=\"https://default.salsalabs.org/T2275859c-6b50-4d9d-aeb6-84fc4e7a6be3/33d01b38-8bbc-4241-987f-47dbf19f474a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://default.salsalabs.org/T2275859c-6b50-4d9d-aeb6-84fc4e7a6be3/33d01b38-8bbc-4241-987f-47dbf19f474a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537248496589000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTxU321wehoWoQksyjchVvXF_M7w\"><em>The following letter was translated for the Comité Cerezo by the Alliance for Global Justice.
