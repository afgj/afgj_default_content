Gutierrez\r\n<strong>Duration:</strong> 5 weeks, online\r\n<a href=\"https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/7315/t/13086/shop/shop.jsp?storefront_KEY=430\">Click here to register now!</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Description:</strong> \r\nIn an increasingly challenging political environment, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and other open government requests can be a powerful tool for obtaining information that activists can use to draw attention to government abuses or to plan more effective strategies. Anyone can file a request - no lawyer is necessary. This course will introduce activists to the FOIA and walk them through the process of filing and pursuing a request. The course will cover an overview of state and federal laws, the type of information available, how to make a request, thinking strategically about who should make the request and where to send the request, the mechanics of negotiating for records (including issues around processing fees), FOIA exemptions, administratively appealing a response, FOIA litigation, strategies for preparing to use the information, and helpful resources. Activists will also share their success stories in using FOIA to challenge government actions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Skills/understanding that activists will have for organizing and opposing militarism after taking this course:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Knowledge of how to think through the strategies for preparing a FOIA request</li>\r\n\t<li>An understanding of how of how to follow up and pursue a response to a FOIA request</li>\r\n\t<li>Ideas for how to use the response for future organizing or media actions</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>About the Instructor: Meet Gitanjali S.
