It is not a\L conference but it is a space to come up with the peoples’ solutions to the \Leconomic and ecological crisis. The USSF is politically and economically independent, and is led by impacted communities. We are not beholden to the power structure, nor to the large institutional funders (sometimes described as the \"non-profit industrial complex\"). We certainly welcome institutional funders to collaborate with us, but we do not allow fundraising to dictate our work.\n\nThe third US Social Forum will be an important step in our\L struggle to build a powerful multi-racial, multi-sectoral, inter-generational, diverse, inclusive, internationalist movement that transforms this country and\L changes history.\n\nWe must declare what we want our world to look like and we \Lmust start planning the path to get there. The USSF provides spaces to learn from each other’s experiences and struggles, share our analysis of the problems \Lour communities face, build relationships, and align with our international \Lbrothers and sisters to strategize how to reclaim our world.\n\nWe live day to day in crisis and struggle. For the first time in history we are experiencing a rapidly deepening crisis of global capitalism affecting millions in the United States and billions world-wide – producing austerity policies and massive permanent unemployment and poverty, unimaginable climate, ecological and social destruction, and intensifying political attacks, repression, and the threat of fascism and war everywhere. At the same time, resistance, activism and organizing are on the rise across all continents, sectors, at nd fronts of struggle.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Where is the US Social Forum being held in each of the location?</strong></p>\nIn Philadelphia, the Forum will be held at Temple University. Howard Gittis Student Center at Temple University (1755 N 13th St Philadelphia, PA) as well as along American Street in Kensington between York Street and Cumberland Street.\n\nIn San Jose the Forum will be centralized at Washington United Youth Center, 921 S. First St, in San Jose along with series of community venues and spaces.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What Happens At A US Social Forum?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Self-Organized Workshops\nPeople's Movement Assemblies\nPlenaries\nExpanded activities with internet and radio interface\nArts &amp; Culture - Performances, Exhibitions, Film Festival\nChildren's Social forum &amp; Youth Activities\nLocal Organizing\nInternational Participation\nDirect Action\nOpen Spaces\nTours\nGrassroots Fundraising\nSkills sharing</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How do I <a href=\"https://www.ussocialforum.net/registration\" target=\"_blank\">register</a> as an individual or an organization?</strong>\nRegistration is available online until June 19th</p>\nRegister as an individual and select the Forum site you're planning to attend\nOR\_Register as an organization and register either three people (for $125) or 10 participants (at $200)\n\nIf you register as an organization, participant can attend the Forum at different sites.

On that note, we are looking for creative concepts and innovative thinkers.
