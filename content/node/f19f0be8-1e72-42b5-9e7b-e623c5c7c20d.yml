As with many people following the situation, I have watched and listened to friends take a harsh line towards one another and with me about articles I have written. While the division in the solidarity movement is not in and of itself new, the tensions have boiled over. The gulf between people over how the situation is understood and should be represented is enormous. There are even calls from some to support U.S. sanctions against the government of Nicaragua, and to expand U.S. pressure on Ortega and the FSLN to step down. My sense is that we must resist this push for U.S. intervention; the potential consequences are dire.\r\n\r\nFor myself, the ghost hovering over my understanding of what is going in Nicaragua, and more to the point, my fear for the future, is not Venezuela or Syria, but Haiti in 2004. At the time, the solidarity community was deeply divided over Aristide’s rule. His effort to craft an institutionalized party (Fanmi Lavalas) from the Lavalas movement had created divisions within that movement; his embrace of some neo-liberal policy reforms, accusations of corruption, and accusations of political violence employed against opponents resulted in many on the left moving into an oppositional position against Aristide. As with Nicaragua today, much of this division was in response to division within Haiti. Groups like Batay Ouvriye and the Plateforme Haïtienne de Plaidoyer pour un Développement Alternatif (PAPDA), all with deep ties to solidarity groups in the U.S., began denouncing Aristide and even calling for his resignation. This sounds all too familiar.\r\n\r\nIn late 2003 and early 2004, armed groups began moving from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, burning police stations and public facilities. As these groups approached Port-au-Prince, the business community was organized into the “Democratic Convergence” with other sectors of civil society, and stepped up their long-time opposition and expanded protests. On February 29, 2004 Aristide was forced to leave Haiti. Escorted to an airfield by U.S. special forces, he was put on a plane to the Central African Republic. His claim that he was forced out of office at the point of a gun, was dismissed out of hand. There was no investigation. Many on the left accepted this de facto coup. Convinced of Aristide’s failings, they accepted at face value the claim that he resigned freely. What might come next seemed to worry them not at all.\r\n\r\nThere was no constitutional transfer of power. With the parliament inactive, the United States, Canada and France essentially handed off leadership to a transitional authority under Gerard Latortue, who had worked previously with the United Nations, and was working as a business consultant and talk radio host in Boca Raton, Florida, when appointed as Prime Minister. The U.S. military was dispatched to “stabilize” the situation, eventually handing over occupation to a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the fall of 2004. Though officially ended last year, a smaller “follow-up” mission continues to be a presence in Haiti 14 years later.\r\n\r\nBetween Aristide’s removal from power and Preval’s re-election in February of 2006, thousands of people died. The international “community” which had denied access to funding to President Preval during his first term, and later Aristide, opened the the aid floodgates for Latortue. Billions of dollars flowed into the country, which, to this day, are largely unaccounted for. Concessions were granted to corporations for large swathes of Haiti’s resources. It was corruption on scale that dwarfed anything Aristide had been accused of (much less proven), all coupled with political violence on a scale that rivaled (and, by some measures, surpassed) the coup regime of 1991-1994.\r\n\r\nThe solidarity community in the United States with ties to Haiti was deeply divided – a division that, whatever else was on the table, constantly came back to the question of Aristide’s rule and his future. It is hard to know what might have been achieved otherwise, but ultimately there was no effective voice to push back against the United States’ propping up of Latortue amidst widespread violence and intensified neo-liberalization. People allied in the anti-Aristide camp, would point to violence by armed groups nominally aligned with Lavalas to justify and ignore the broader destruction taking place.\r\n\r\nSince April 18 of this year, I have had a strong feeling of deja vu. Obviously there are enormous differences between Haiti and Nicaragua. The FSLN is deeply entrenched in the economic, social and political life of Nicaragua, in a way that Fanmi Lavalas was never able to achieve in Haiti. Nicaragua’s democratic institutions are more deeply embedded, and even if one accepts the worst about Ortega’s machinations, there is a baseline of stability in Nicaragua that Haiti, under constant intervention from the United States, has not been able to achieve.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this means that Nicaragua is able to resist intervention to a greater degree. This is evident whether one accepts the “coup has been defeated” narrative, or the “government remains intransigent” narrative, as both interpretations speak to the resilience of the state in the face of external pressure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if Ortega is ultimately forced from power, what comes next could be accompanied by even greater bloodshed, given the embeddedness of the FSLN. I am convinced that there is no way Ortega’s resignation, or even early elections, will satisfy the United States and those in the opposition who have aligned with U.S. policy-makers in the long-term. Why? Because the FSLN will remain the largest, most stable party in Nicaragua even without Ortega. Indeed, even if Ortega were to resign, unless the constitution is simply thrown out the window, a Sandinista will replace him, as his replacement would be left to the National Assembly to choose. If early elections are held, the FSLN will very likely win a large portion of seats in the assembly, if not a majority – and possibly the presidency – depending on who runs. None of this will be acceptable to the United States and allied forces in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in Haiti is also instructive about the future of the FSLN under U.S.-brokered regime change. In the wake of Aristide’s “resignation,” the United States transformed the political arena, defended the pillaging of the economy, and practically destroyed Fanmi Lavalas (ironically by trying to take it over in an absurd effort to clear the way for Marc Bazan – a long-time opponent of Lavalas – to run as the Fanmi Lavalas candidate in 2006). Preval’s return to power at the head of the Lespwa coalition in 2006, despite all of the U.S.’s efforts, would mark the last “free” election in Haiti. In 2010, amidst the aftershocks of the earthquake, the vote was simply discarded. The U.S.-supported candidate, Martelly, was put into a runoff in place of the Lespwa candidate who had actually received more votes in the first round. With this decision made under unrelenting pressure and threats of sanctions from the U.S. government, Martelly would go on to win, amidst widespread abstention. Lavalas was excluded entirely from the election.\r\n\r\nFor those of us in the solidarity community, I suggest we take seriously the hard-earned lessons of the Haitian example in 2004. Calling for accountability regarding the violence in Nicaragua, both from state forces and armed groups aligned with the opposition, is important; but I would emphasize that this accountability should come through domestic channels or the multilateral forums that Nicaragua participates in. This week, the government has invited the United Nations, the Vatican and members of the European Human Rights community to help mediate a new, expanded round of national dialogue. This has the potential for achieving an accounting of what has transpired, and creating a path toward resolution and reconciliation.\r\n\r\nContinuing to call for Ortega’s removal from power, and inviting further intervention from the United States in the form of sanctions that would only further destabilize and polarize the situation in Nicaragua, seems like a really bad idea. Marco Rubio, who has led the right-wing charge against the FSLN in the Senate, has even spoken of the\_<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/22/rubio-warns-of-possible-civil-war-in-nicaragua-735560\"><b>possibility of war in Nicaragua</b></a>, and has tried to recast the crisis as a national security issue for the United States. Rubio and his partners in Congress make strange allies for those on the left, and they are certainly not the allies of the majority of people in Nicaragua. Those with such a policy orientation have no track record of bringing democracy to any part of the world. Nor, clearly, is that their intention.\r\n\r\nAs the violence on the ground in Nicaragua has subsided dramatically over the last two weeks, there is space for a conversation about long-term political solutions. We should welcome and support this opening. But inviting alliances with those on the political right in the United States, which has long sought to dismantle the Sandinista government, is about the worst thing that could be done for Nicaragua.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:5px;\">\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Central Bank President Affirms There Is No Devaluation Planned for the Cordoba</b>\r\n\r\nIn recent days the opposition media has practiced what can only be called economic terrorism printing that there is or will be a devaluation of the Córdoba, Nicaragua’s currency. \_They have been encouraging people to remove their money from the banks. On Channel 6 and on Adolfo Pastran’s show the Central Bank President, Ovidio Reyes, denied all of these charges. “The exchange rate will continue exactly as it has in recent years. We have sufficient reserves to change all the Córdobas to dollars and still have millions left over. \_And we have dollars to back up everyone’s deposits. Two billion, four hundred fifty-seven million are the reserves today. We have 2.9 times the monetary base.” He said that, because of the instability in Nicaragua, some people are worried and want someplace else to put their money. Or they want someplace where they will get a better interest rate. So the government now has bonds that the public can invest in. They can deposit in dollars or Córdobas and the interest rate is good, Reyes said.

The meeting, held on July 19, was also at the United Nations headquarters. No restoration of dialogue is foreseen, nor is it known what role the UN will play. \"When we have something to announce, we will announce it,\" said Guterres' spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric. Foreign Minister Moncada did not respond to journalists’ questions. He did say that his meeting with Guterres was \"very good, an excellent meeting.\" (Informe Pastran 8/27/18)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Elections on Caribbean Coast Scheduled for March 3, 2019</b>\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Electoral Council announced that regional elections will be held in the North and South Caribbean Autonomous Regions on March 3, 2019, and called on all legally constituted political parties to meet to elect members of the Regional Electoral Councils. Lumberto Campbell, vice-president of the Supreme Electoral Council, stated that the political groups participating in the elections must include in their slates of candidates representatives of all the ethnic groups of the two regions and also maintain gender equity. Voters will elect the regional governments of the north and south regions and the territorial governments of the 23 Indigenous and Afro-descendant territories.

They were also commemorating the 38th anniversary of the famous Literacy Campaign and the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Sandinista Youth. \_Walking all through Managua to arrive downtown on the Simon Bolivar Avenue, they demanded the recognition of the human rights of all Nicaraguans. Famous literacy teacher Orlando Pineda pointed out that the first mandate of the revolution, given to the youth, was to erase illiteracy. He said Nicaragua inherited a 64% illiteracy rate from Somoza.

Bautista [who was second in command of the National Police until 2005] says that in the last four to five weeks he has observed an accelerated return to normalcy in businesses, in transit, and in the general economic and social activity of the population. The damage done from April to July is, in the first place, the human and moral damage, which he said is irreversible. \_Also, people were accustomed to being proud of Nicaragua’s levels of peace, stability, security, tourism and growth and suddenly this all fell apart. The second important type of damage was the material and economic: Some experts estimate as many as 100,000 jobs were lost or about 8% of formal employment. The third type of damage was to Nicaragua’s image internationally. In the international media, there was a great deal of manipulation and bias against Nicaragua. The actions of the Secretary of the OAS and others could be counterproductive if they take biased positions towards Nicaragua without looking for consensus and equilibrium.

The trial consisted of eight public sessions. The prosecutor called seventeen witnesses. Glen said that he was trying to shoot Gahona, not the policeman. This session lasted 13 hours. The prosecution requested the application of the maximum sentence established by law (30 years) for the crimes of murder, attempted murder, illegal possession of arms and ammunition, exposure of people and abandonment of persons. Sentencing will happen on August 30. Assistant prosecutor Inés Miranda Mercado expressed her satisfaction at being able to get justice for the journalist Ángel Eduardo Gahona. \_(Channel 8, 8/27/18)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Terrorists to Trial for Crimes in Masaya</b>\r\n\r\nChristian Rodriquez Fajardo and his wife Maria Adilia Peralta are charged with terrorism, organized crime, kidnapping, assassination, profaning of cadavers, financing of terrorism, burning of government buildings and atrocious crimes against government workers. According to investigations they began receiving money from organizations in Miami in April. The prosecutor says that they were the people supporting the delinquents at the roadblocks in Masaya, its municipalities, and in Granada. Their right-hand person, from Monimbo, known as Chilo, is on the run. He was in charge of contracting the delinquents. One of their many victims was police official Rodrigo Alfredo Barrio Flores. They stopped him at a roadblock and on finding something in his billfold they brutally tortured and left him for dead, dumping his body in the weeds. \_Another victim was police official Gabriel de Jesus Vado Ruiz. On July 14, dressed in civilian clothes and headed home for the weekend, Vado Ruiz was grabbed at a roadblock in Masaya. He was beaten and tortured and his motorcycle was burned. On telephone orders from Christian Rodriguez Fajardo his attackers shot him and stabbed him multiple times. Later they burned his body in the public square. <a href=\"https://www.tn8.tv/sucesos/456060-terroristas-juicio-crimenes-masaya/\">https://www.tn8.tv/sucesos/456060-terroristas-juicio-crimenes-masaya/</a> \_(Channel 8, 8/24/18)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Leader of Violent Acts in Masaya gave Public Testimony on August 27 and asked Forgiveness</b>\r\n\r\nThe brother of Christian Rodriguez Fajardo, Santiago Adrian Fajardo Baldizon, arrested August 23, gave public testimony on August 27 in which he recognized his brother as the leader and person who received money for the criminal activities in Masaya.
