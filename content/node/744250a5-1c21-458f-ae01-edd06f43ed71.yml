The victims of this policy are the Venezuelan people, who would be much better off with a policy of de-escalation, dialogue and a removal of the deadly sanctions.</span></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://peoplesdispatch.org/2020/03/26/as-the-world-tackles-the-covid-19-pandemic-the-us-raises-the-pressure-on-venezuela/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://peoplesdispatch.org/2020/03/26/as-the-world-tackles-the-covid-19-pandemic-the-us-raises-the-pressure-on-venezuela/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585424052367000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRDFL9aaONzE8oi0kacP_edT5GFQ\">PeoplesDispatch (Vijay Prashad, others): As the world tackles the Pandemic, the US charges Nicolas Maduro and others with drug-trafficking, puts a bounty on his head</a> In the March 26 press conference, it was almost comical how little evidence the U.S.\_ provided when it accused Venezuela’s President Maduro and several of the leaders of his government of narco-trafficking. The U.S. offered $15 million for the arrest of Maduro and $10 million for the others. Maduro, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said dramatically, “very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.” Evidence for this? Not presented at all. It is surreal that the US - during the COVID19 global pandemic- chooses to put its efforts into this ridiculous, evidence-free indictment against Maduro and other members of the government.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A few hours before the announcement, word spread that the US was going to place Venezuela’s government on the “state sponsor of terrorism” list—the highest condemnation of a government. But they had to pause. And the pause itself came for absurd reasons. If the US accused Maduro’s government of being a “state sponsor of terrorism,” then it would be acknowledging that the Maduro government was indeed the government of Venezuela.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.state.gov/department-of-state-offers-rewards-for-information-to-bring-venezuelan-drug-traffickers-to-justice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.state.gov/department-of-state-offers-rewards-for-information-to-bring-venezuelan-drug-traffickers-to-justice/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585424052367000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_xfB6d6bTBY7wMmjStK_Q6utERw\">US State Department statement: $15 million reward for Nicolas Maduro for “drug trafficking”, Diosdado Cabello $10M</a> “Today the U.
