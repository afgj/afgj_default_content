This article was originally published in </span></i><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/07/15/a-year-after-nicaraguas-coup-the-medias-regime-change-deceptions-are-still-unraveling/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Grayzone</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s failed coup in Nicaragua erupted when student protests against social security reforms quickly turned into an armed attempt to bring down the government of Daniel Ortega. The regime change attempt was a battle for people’s minds as well as for control of the streets. Violence was used to terrorize government supporters, but it was even more important as a propaganda vehicle. A journalist shot while on camera, demonstrators hit by sniper fire or an arson attack on a family home were all high profile crimes that were immediately blamed on the government. Key to the anti-Sandinista public relations blitz was an organized barrage of social media postings, indignant statements by local “human rights” bodies condemning the government, right-wing media reaching the same judgment and local people intimidated into “confirming” the story.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During their push for Ortega’s ouster last year, opposition groups acted on the largely correct assumption that if they were quick to portray any violence as being the government’s fault, a compliant international press would repeat it. Major international human rights NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch could be relied on to take the judgments of their local counterparts at face value. Once a consensus about how to portray the violence had been reached internationally, it would be repeated by regional and global bodies such as the Organization of American States and the UN, and inevitably by the US State Department. After a series of such violent incidents, the reputation of the Ortega government internationally was sealed.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The worst of these attacks occurred on June 16 last year. At 6:00 in the morning, in the Managua </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> known as Carlos Marx, masked youths threw Molotov cocktails into an occupied three-story house. Fire spread quickly from the ground floor, used for a family business of making mattresses, to the living rooms upstairs where the family was beginning its day. Neighbours rushed to help but six people were burnt alive, including a baby and a two year-old girl.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could easily have been a self-inflicted blow to the “peaceful” image the protesters had created. But instead it became emblematic of the government’s supposed violent response to the protests. How was this achieved?\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among those quickly on the scene was a representative of local “human rights” body, CENIDH: Gonzalo Carrion. Student eyewitnesses reported that Carrion had been present when opposition militants took over the campus of the UNAN university earlier in the attempted coup, and had even been a bystander to their violence. Without any obvious prior investigation, he recorded an interview blaming the fire on government supporters, calling it the act of a “terrorist state.” This was, of course, consistent with </span><a href=\"http://tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3859\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a pattern of misreporting by CENIDH</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout the coup.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also quick to arrive were reporters from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canal 10</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the opposition-supporting TV channel: they interviewed one of the survivors, pressuring him to blame the police for the arson attack. Much later he would explain how his vulnerability, in the midst of attempts to find his family and surrounded by opposition supporters, was abused. Nicaragua’s main daily right-wing newspaper, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Prensa,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also had no doubt who the culprits were: “Ortega mobs burn and kill a Managua family” ran its </span><a href=\"https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2018/06/16/nacionales/2436445-al-menos-dos-ninos-heridos-en-un-incendio-en-el-barrio-carlos-marx-managua\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">headline</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the following day.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that stage, the reality was that no outsiders knew who the masked youths were who had started the fire, nor did the journalists who arrived make much attempt to find out. Hundreds of thousands of social media messages began to appear, blaming the government. The international press, as on so many occasions, took its lead from the local media. </span><a href=\"https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1JC0VW\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reuters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an agency which has consistently taken </span><a href=\"https://fair.org/home/distorting-past-and-present-reuters-on-nicaraguas-armed-uprising/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an anti-Ortega line</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, gave prominence to the government’s accusers and quoted the secretary of the Organization of American States describing it as “a crime against humanity”. A </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/mundo/44510308\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BBC report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was more balanced, but still emphasized the accusations against the government. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">put the house fire together with other incidents to describe what it called </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/world/americas/nicaragua-peace-talks-violence.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a campaign of terror</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by forces backing Ortega. The US State Department quickly </span><a href=\"https://www.state.gov/ongoing-violence-in-nicaragua/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">concurred</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, saying the attack was “government sponsored”. Within a week, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights </span><a href=\"http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2018/134.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">repeated the accusation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, based on “public statements” that it didn’t identify.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it happened, when the fire occurred I was preparing an article about the coup for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Not surprisingly, they asked me to extend the article to include it. Writing only 48 hours afterwards, and influenced by the initial reports, my assessment (</span><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/two-months-unrest-nicaragua-fateful-crossroad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published on June 22</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) was inevitably tentative:\_</span>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘The government was quickly blamed, because allegedly the fire was in reprisal for the owner’s refusal to allow snipers to operate from his roof. Government denials seemed plausible, as the barrio concerned has numerous barricades controlled by the opposition. On the other hand, a surviving family member backs up the opposition version. The truth is difficult to ascertain, and if proof emerges, it is unlikely to dispel the media verdicts about who the real culprits were.’</span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, as I live in Masaya, a city which at the time was cut off from the rest of Nicaragua by opposition roadblocks, I could not personally visit Managua.\_ Had I done so, I would have quickly seen that the consensus view of who caused the fire was unlikely to be correct, because for weeks the Carlos Marx </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had been sealed off by roadblocks manned by armed protesters. A </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alfredo.pavon.925/videos/pcb.843581209161650/843579985828439/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posted on Facebook, allegedly showing police trucks in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was later shown to have been made almost two months earlier.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were other obvious questions about the incident. For example, how was it that the CENIDH representatives (well known to be anti-government) were on the scene so quickly? Why would police or government supporters suddenly start setting houses on fire, when it was the opposition that had recently burned down a local government office in the same </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Why did no one investigate explicit social media threats which had been made against the family by protesters – including </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/madeleintlSUR/status/1008335402959364099\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one made only 38 hours before the fire was started</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Or the fact that four members of the M-19 (an armed opposition group) were on the scene later the same day, to record a </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Mov19Abril/videos/247105966040187/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (now erased) where they accuse the government of “state terrorism” and admit they controlled the roadblocks in the area? Their message says: “We are not going to remove the roadblocks, they are in our hands and those of the people, and we will not take them off. I want you to know: if the people do not unite, it will end up in new massacres like this one.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My assertion that any doubts about who caused the fire would be unlikely to dispel the media verdicts, was proved correct. The simple reason was that neither local nor international media were interested in addressing these questions, as was soon demonstrated by coverage in the UK by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The newspaper had already published 13 news stories about the violence in Nicaragua by early July, its Latin American correspondent had visited the country in June and I had told him about the opposition’s arson attacks. By the time </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> freelance reporters Carl David Goette-Luciak and Caroline Houck covered the story on July 5, some of the facts about the fire had begun to emerge. Even so, rather than questioning the consensus narrative, they reinforced it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> story appeared, police had succeeded in reaching the crime scene. But it was not until December 19 that the police were able to arrest two suspects and identify four others (local media quickly labelled those arrested as “political prisoners”). Why did it take so long to identify the arsonists? Apart from the difficulty the police had in entering the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there were other obstacles. The roadblocks made it very easy for the masked attackers to slip away undetected, and local people were frightened to denounce them even if they knew who they were. Soon after escaping the fire, the surviving family members were surrounded by protesters and opposition journalists demanding that they denounce the police, which some of them did. These family members were then quickly taken into hiding by CENIDH, the “human rights” group, in a way which one of the family later described as being kidnapped. They were prevented from making phone calls “for their own safety”, and of course were unavailable for police interviews.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January, independent journalists Dick and Miriam Emanuelsson started to ask the questions that the international media had ignored. They found that, six months after the fire, local people in the Carlos Marx </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were more willing to talk. They also interviewed a police official responsible for the investigation. Their </span><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/342397232\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> casts further light on events. First, it is now clear that there were around 30 roadblocks preventing movement into or around the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Second, local people confirmed that the armed groups controlling the roadblocks determined who could pass through. Third, in lengthy interviews, the surviving family members (one a 14 year-old girl with horrendous burns) described how they were threatened by the protesters, before and after the fire. They said that they were scared by them into denouncing the police and were whisked away while injured and in severe shock, and later offered visas by CENIDH to leave the country. Fourth, the police explain the evidence they were able to assemble and how they did it, including testimony from protesters who knew who had carried out the attack. Some of the evidence and interviews are now available in English, one year after the fire, in </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz6kJ-tRNJI&amp;list=PL60rwmBGSBm8GX8ffQhZvvJetUjqNp7Bd\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a short documentary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is part of a series produced by local film producers </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juventud Presidente</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the treatment by the international media of the Carlos Marx house fire were exceptional, it might not be so important that they overlooked basic facts in this case. But sadly this pattern was repeated in coverage of most of the worst incidents in last year’s violence in Nicaragua, including the murder of the journalist Ángel Gahona while he was broadcasting live in Bluefields (also </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/nicaragua-journalist-killed-live-on-air-angel-gahona\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">covered by Goette-Luciak</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and the murder of four police officers and a teacher in an armed attack in the small town of Morrito. Hardly an incident occurred in which the main international media, including ones like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who take pride in their independent journalism, based their reports on opposition accusations that crimes were committed by government supporters, when in fact the culprits were armed protesters.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same freelance reporters, Goette-Luciak and Houck, had earlier </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/in-nicaragua-a-town-of-fighters-is-at-the-heart-of-an-intensifying-crisis/2018/06/23/7b54163c-764b-11e8-bda1-18e53a448a14_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d1b2f4c330db\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported from Masaya</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washington Post, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">where they also minimized opposition violence. They went on to produce a similarly unbalanced story for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/07/nicaragua-strike-latest-news-ortega-crisis-opposition-protesters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September 7</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about an opposition-led strike.

Later, in a surprising twist, Goette-Luciak was exposed by journalist </span><a href=\"https://www.thecanary.co/exclusive/2018/10/04/longtime-friend-of-deported-guardian-reporter-speaks-out-on-their-work-inhabiting-the-role-of-a-foreign-agent-of-imperialism-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Blumenthal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as being far from politically neutral: he was actively working with anti-Ortega opposition groups.

Instead of asking what is really happening in the country, the international press has eagerly promoted Washington’s preferred narrative about Nicaragua. As the writer Nick Davies put it in his book <a href=\"https://www.flatearthnews.net/\">Flat Earth News</a>, it’s not journalism’s job to report that people say it’s raining, it’s journalism’s job to look out of the window. In a country like Nicaragua, if the international media send reporters who simply repeat what they’re told by one side, then they’re serving that side’s interests. When their reports bolster the arguments of a Trump administration looking to impose its neoliberal model on the whole of Latin America, they become far more than an attack on Daniel Ortega’s government: they are an attack on the majority of Nicaraguans who now want a return to peace and economic stability.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Briefs</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>World Bank Says Nicaragua has the Best Execution of Projects\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A World Bank mission that is in Nicaragua evaluating the progress of road infrastructure projects, has recognized that “Nicaragua has executed the best World Bank project portfolio”.

The cost of transportation also decreased, saving money and time. He noted, “Before I had to leave Bluefields early in the morning by boat to El Rama then by bus to Managua. Now buses leave every half hour.” (Radiolaprimerisima, 8/9/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>More Assistance for Exports from Micro, Small and Medium-Size Businesses\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Association of Producers and Exporters (APEN) is supporting 6,177 families in the agricultural sector and 822 artisans from the departments of Matagalpa, Jinotega, Masaya and Carazo to export their products to international markets.

The difference lies in the fact that from April to July 2018 Nicaragua experienced violence associated with an attempted coup d'état, characterized, among other elements, by roadblocks on public roads to impede the free movement of vehicles and people, including for health reasons. According to MINSA's balance sheet, at the end of 2018 13,300 Nicaraguans recovered their vision as a result of Operation Miracle, and by the end of 2019, 15,000 people are expected to benefit from the planned surgeries.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operation Miracle was conceived and promoted by the leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, for the treatment of ophthalmological diseases for those without resources. The program began in Nicaragua in 2007 with the arrival of Cuban doctors who by the end of 2012 had treated 95,000 patients. At the same time the doctors trained Nicaraguan specialists, and Operation Miracle is now run by Nicaraguans.

They would help the women get visas and give them a thousand dollars. But on arrival in Spain everything would be taken away and the women told they were now in debt to the tune of nearly 6,000 euros. The women were employed in elder care and had to give the gang 85% of what they earned. It is thought that since 2016 the gang trafficked fifty women and earned about 750,000 euros. They operated in the Spanish cities of Madrid, Rioja and Huesca.\_ The four women and three men face charges of human trafficking for labor exploitation, money-laundering and belonging to a criminal organization.
