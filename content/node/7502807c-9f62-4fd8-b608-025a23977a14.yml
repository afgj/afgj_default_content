First extended\_when\_Hurricane Mitch devastated Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador in 1998,\_Nicaragua was the first\_country to lose TPS status during an overall review of\_TPS by the Trump administration. About 200,000\_Central Americans and Haitians\_are protected by TPS. Nicaragua’s share is a miniscule 2,200 or so.\n\nWhile Nicaragua Network/Alliance for Global Justice’s position is that\_borders should be as free to workers\_as they are to capital, the loss of TPS\_for Nicaraguans is also a recognition of the strides that Nicaragua\_has made\_since the Sandinista party, led by President Daniele Ortega, returned to power\_through elections\_in 2007.\n\nWith 10 years of sustained economic growth at or around 5%, the country\_is booming. Formal employment\_is at an all-time high. Minimum wages rise every\_six months, negotiated in a unique Tripartite Model in\_which unions and\_business owners in the various sectors negotiate the amount of increase with\_the\_government sitting in as the tie-breaker. This has led to an unparalleled\_period of labor stability, foreign\_investment, and job growth.\n\nSandinista policies of free education and healthcare, revitalizing the\_peasant agricultural sector, extending\_water, sewer, and electricity coverage,\_especially in rural areas, and several poverty alleviation programs\_like zero\_poverty, zero usury, credit for micro, small, and medium enterprises led by\_women and in the\_rapidly-growing tourism sector, all have combined to create\_what some would call an economic miracle in\_Nicaragua.\n\nBut, there is nothing miraculous about it. It is the result of\_hard-headed political and economic decisions by\_the Ortega government to stand\_up to the IMF and its structural adjustment, neoliberal prescriptions of pain\_and privation and instead prove that macroeconomic stability could be achieved\_at the same time as the\_country became one of the first in the world to achieve\_the UN Millennium Goals on poverty reduction.\n\nBy the same token, there are no political prisoners in Nicaragua. There\_are no State-sponsored political\_murders. There is no press censorship. Drug\_cartels have not been able to establish a foothold in the\_country because its\_National Police, born of the Revolution, is not corrupt. Nicaragua has the\_lowest\_homicide rate, and is the safest country in Central America – including\_Costa Rica.\n\nLeaving aside the argument that people should be able to live and work\_where they want to, Nicaraguans\_don’t need the US’s TPS anymore. They can\_return home in safety and security and with a near certainty\_that they can find\_a job and live in a house with electricity and flush toilets! Anyone who\_traveled to\_Nicaragua during the 1980s and 1990s will understand just how major\_that is.\n\nBut, of course, the other side of the coin is that the Trump regime\_shouldn’t be telling people who have\_made lives in the United States for nearly\_30 years that they have to go home to a place they hardly know\_and where their\_children and grandchildren may not even speak the language.\n\nMy co-writer of this blog, John Kotula, has written a poem expressing\_this side of the coin.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>On The Same Day</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>By John Kotula</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Trump says</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">2,500 Nicaraguans</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Must go,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I go to the mall</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In Managua</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">For 2 X 2 color photos</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">No glasses,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Neutral expression,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Natural smile</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To renew my passport.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Like Superman</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Leaping buildings</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I cross fronteras</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In a single bound.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">My passport</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Sports an eagle and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Stars and stripes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">One look at the old,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Well fed, white guy</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In the photo</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">And nobody</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Seeks votes</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">By claiming</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I’ll take their job,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Rob their house</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Or rape their granny,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">But back in the</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">US of A</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">No “bad hombres”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Are allowed,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Even if</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">They work,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Pay taxes,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Own a home,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Have kids,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Coach little league,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dress up for Halloween,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Bake apple pies, and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Deck their lawns</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">With inflatable</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Snow men.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">On the same day</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Trump says</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">2,500 Nicaraguans</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Must go,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I am made welcome</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In Managua.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>BRIEFS</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">The United Nations Children’s\_Fund (UNICEF) Country Representative, Iván Yerovi said Nicaragua is recognized\_internationally for its\_achievements in meeting the Millennium Development\_Goals (MDGs). “Aspects such as greater access to healthcare and education,\_potable\_water service, the fight against poverty and lowering of maternal and\_infant mortality rates, confirms that Nicaragua is on the right path,” the\_UNICEF Country Representative said.
