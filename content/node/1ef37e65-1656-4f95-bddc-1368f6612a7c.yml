The majority of political prisoners are being held in military-run, maximum-security prisons where they face years of pre-trial detention. They are being persecuted, falsely charged and held in the harshest conditions usually reserved for violent criminals for demanding economic, political, and social change in Honduras. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The refugees in the caravan traveling to the U.S. border have fled Honduras for the same reasons that Honduran political prisoners are incarcerated: both are resisting the U.S.- and Canadian-supported Honduran dictatorship under Juan Orlando Hernandez. Honduran refugees and political prisoners alike seek a viable, humane solution to the nationwide crisis provoked by the 2009 military coup and (most recently) repression and other violent state policies linked to the 2017 electoral fraud.
