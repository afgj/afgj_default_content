As such, their position is much more dangerous than those of admitted right-wing organizations.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The statement is co-signed by PROVEA and other USA/Western funded NGOs in Venezuela.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We are happy to note that the countries of Latina American and the Caribbean have already unanimously condemned\_ U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and have also unanimously called on President Obama to revoke his Executive Order calling Venezuela an \"extraordinary threat to U.S. national security.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Related reference material and WOLA contact information \_is below.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Please call\_ or email today and let WOLA know we object to their distortions and parroting of US State Department allegations.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Muchas Gracias Amigos,</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Chuck Kaufman, Alliance for Global Justice</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Stan Smith, Chicago ALBA Solidarity Committee</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Roger Harris, President, Task Force on the Americas</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Charlie Hardy</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Lee Artz, Media Studies, Purdue University Calumet</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">************************</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">1. Contact information for WOLA</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">WOLA Tel: (202) 797-2171 \_<a href=\"mailto:press@wola.org\"><span class=\"s2\">press@wola.org</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">2. Who signed the statement? :</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Joy Olson is the executive director of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Juana Kweitel is a program director at Conectas Human Rights.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Marino Alvarado Betancourt is a member of the Permanent Commission at the Venezuelan Program for Education and Action in Human Rights (PROVEA).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Gastón Chillier is the executive director of the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Vera Jarach is a member of Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, Linea Fundadora.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">3.\_ Regarding ProVEA</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Romero, ProVEA and other Maduro critics are relentless in their claims that armed motorcyclists allied with the administration are perpetrating violence against peaceful opposition members.”</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=gEp3kAd2EZuV2PCZuGxjocHTxaLa%2Bfwm\">http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/10725</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">4. Regarding ProVea funding:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\_“Our challenge is how not to disappear,” said Marino Alvarado, who heads Provea, a human rights group that relies almost exclusively on overseas funds, including donations from the European Union and US-based NGOs but not the US government. “</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=tYbndk74UTS33arMf2abEMHTxaLa%2Bfwm\">http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/58157/ch%C3%A1vez%E2%80%99s-new-threat-funding-at-risk-for-activists</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">see also:</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=PIbp7OD%2Fz8OkZTV%2B5hSPa8HTxaLa%2Bfwm\">http://venezuelawearewithyou.blogspot.com/2010/12/ngo-provea-in-venezuela-paid-in-us.html</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\_5. Regarding Latin American and Caribbean statement denouncing US sanctions against Venezuela at CELAC meeting.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=yB49ZPeW9MRMFjNWG%2BM5JcHTxaLa%2Bfwm\">http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/11178</a></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
