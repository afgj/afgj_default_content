The\_delegation compared and contrasted the two counties in the areas of rural development, citizen security, and women’s\_empowerment. In Nicaragua we were hosted by the ATC farmworkers union.<a href=\"https://afgj.org/delegation-report-honduras-nicaragua-compare-contrast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\_You can read or download the 27-page report\_here. </a>Special thanks to Llana Barber for most of the narrative and to John Mejia for the photographs. Feel free to use all or\_parts of the report with credit to Nicaragua Network/Alliance for Global Justice.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>BRIEFS</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A Moody's rating agency report issued last Thursday, assigned a B2 score to the Nicaragua sovereign debt with a\_stable outlook.\_The report noted that Nicaragua has maintained a 4.5% sustained economic growth rate, with moderate\_public debt and high levels of foreign direct investments. \"The Nicaragua government has maintained a close working\_relationship with the International Monetary Fund and has established a successful Tripartite Alliance Model between\_government, employers and labor,\" the Moody's report said. (Nicaragua News, May 26)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>A two-day OAS Mission met last week with “members of the Constructive Dialogue Commission, representatives of\_the diplomatic corps and international organizations accredited in the country,\" according to Vice-President Rosario Murillo.\_The OAS has offered technical support to the Supreme Electoral Council to improve voter registration, issuing of\_identification cards, and updating of voter rolls. “Through these efforts we want to reaffirm the strong commitment of\_Secretary General Luis Almagro to work on strengthening democracy and the improvement of electoral processes in\_Nicaragua,” OAS Chief of Staff Gonzalo Koncke stated. Gerardo de Icaza, director of the Electoral Cooperation Department\_of the OAS also announced that a mission of 120 electoral observers will cover Nicaragua’s\_Nov. 5\_municipal elections.\_“The electoral observation mission will arrive in Nicaragua on\_June 15\_and observers will be deployed in the 15\_departments of the country and the two autonomous regions of the Caribbean Coast,” he said. (Nicaragua News, May 24,\_25)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>A CID Gallup poll carried out between May 11-19, found that President Daniel Ortega has a 64% popular support\_among the Nicaraguan people. Fifty-four percent of respondents said President Ortega always does what’s best for the\_country and 56% expressed strong approval for the management of the government. (Nicaragua News May 25)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>According to the Nicaraguan Energy Institute annual report, in 2016 Nicaragua generated 52.8% of its electricity\_from renewable sources compared to 26.86% in 2006. Energy expert Patricia Rodriguez said that Nicaragua has the best\_potential in Central America to generate clean energy. She noted that the initial investment is high, but in the long run\_energy from renewable sources is more profitable because the hydro, wind, and geothermal systems are cheaper to\_operate than petroleum based systems. \_“A renewable plant does not change its prices year after year as happens with\_petroleum plants where at any time prices can rise with the price of crude oil,” she said. (El Nuevo Diario, May 29)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li>One quarter of Nicaraguan children under two years of age are underweight for their age, according to a Ministry of\_Health study carried out between February and April of this year and released on May 29. Pediatrician Katherine Bradford\_said that malnutrition in children under two could be prevented if mothers would breast feed their babies exclusively longer.\_These figures have gone down from the Ministry’s Nutritional Census of 2015 and 2014. However, Dr. Ivania Gonzalez, an\_expert in pediatric nutrition, said that obesity in small children is on the increase with 10% overweight and 5.3% obese. She\_said that this type of malnutrition is due “above all because the children are including in their diet very sugary drinks and\_they have less physical activity.” (El Nuevo Diario, May 29)</li>\n</ul>"
