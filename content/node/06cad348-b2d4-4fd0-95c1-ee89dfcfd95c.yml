It is the responsibility of all board members, officers, employees and volunteers to report concerns about violations of AFGJ’s code of ethics or suspected violations of law or regulations that govern AFGJ’s operations.</span></span> <strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">No Retaliation</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It is contrary to the values of AFGJ for anyone to retaliate against any board member, officer, employee or volunteer who in good faith reports an ethics violation, or a suspected violation of law, such as a complaint of discrimination, or suspected fraud, or suspected violation of any regulation governing the operations of AFGJ. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.</span></span> <strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Reporting Procedure</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">AFGJ has an open door policy and suggests that employees share their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints with the collective. If you are not comfortable speaking with the whole collective, you are encouraged to speak with the collective staff member of your choosing, or a collective board member. Selected committees within the board staff collective has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints. </span></span> <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Compliance Officer</strong> </span></span> <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">AFGJ’s Co-Coordinators are responsible for ensuring that all complaints about unethical or illegal conduct are investigated and resolved. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span> <strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Accounting and Auditing Matters</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">AFGJ Co-Coordinators shall immediately notify the Finance Committee of any concerns or complaint regarding corporate accounting practices, internal controls or auditing and work with the committee until the matter is resolved.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Acting in Good Faith</span></span></strong> <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Anyone filing a written complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.</span></span> <strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Confidentiality</span></span></strong> <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Violations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis by the complainant.
