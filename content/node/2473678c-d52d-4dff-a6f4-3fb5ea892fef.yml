      value: "<em>By Dr. Paul Oquist</em>\r\n\r\nTranslated by Tortillaconsal.com\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>[Editor’s Note: Nicaragua’s message to the Nov. 11-22, 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, COP25, seems particularly relevant as our first blog of 2020 due to the fires still raging in Australia, Time Magazine’s naming of young climate change activist Greta Thunberg as the Person of the Year, and the growth around the world of grassroots “Extinction Rebellion” actions. Nicaragua represents the perspective of countries which contribute the least to the production of greenhouse gases, but are most vulnerable to their climate changing effects.]</strong> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">December 11th 2019</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Paul Oquist Kelley Minister-Private Secretary for National Policies Presidency of the Republic of Nicaragua</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Madam President</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Excellencies, Ministers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Guests</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and Vice President Compañera Rosario Murillo Zambrana, send their greetings and best wishes for the success of this COP, aimed at achieving a higher level of commitment and climate action.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities are not political positions but objective historical and contemporary realities. To maintain that we are all historically responsible for climate change would be tantamount to saying that we all participated equally in the Industrial Revolution, as well as in the massive accumulation of capital resulting from it. This was when most of our countries suffered at that time the yoke of colonialism and neocolonialism, as well as the slave trade and the exploitation of slave labor, which also contributed to the historical accumulation of those responsible.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain that we are all equally and universally responsible for greenhouse gas emissions today, is equivalent to saying that the 100 countries with the lowest emissions that account for 3% of the total, have the same responsibility as the ten countries with the highest emissions that account for 72% of the total. At the same time, it is equivalent to saying that most countries with less than one ton of CO2 equivalent per capita have the same responsibility as countries with 18 tons or 16 tons per capita.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My country, Nicaragua, contributes 0.03% of total global emissions, with a per capita of 0.63 tons. Despite our negligible level of responsibility, we are actively working on mitigation and adaptation, as well as loss and damage, because we love Mother Earth, and we are concerned about the future of our country and the world. Nicaragua has gone from 25% renewable energy in 2007 to 62% in 2018, while electricity coverage has expanded from 54% of households in 2007 to 95% in 2018. We are committed to the 30x30 initiative to restore 2.8 million hectares degraded due to a historic, active agricultural frontier. We have committed in the Forest Carbon Partnership to capture 11 million tons of CO2(e) [carbon dioxide equivalent] over the next five years. We are also adapting a dry corridor to the new reality of climate change.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This effort has been in the context of average annual economic growth of 4.7% between 2011 and 2017, the third highest rate among the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, accompanied by great social advances. These include the reduction of the maternal mortality rate from 92.8 per hundred thousand in 2007 to 34.1 today, and the reduction of the infant mortality rate from 29 to 12 per thousand children born. Chronic malnutrition in schools was reduced by 66%. General poverty was reduced from 47.9% to 24.9%, and extreme poverty from 17.3% to 6.9%. Very important in this world, the GINI measure of inequality in consumption went from 0.41 to 0.33. Nicaragua. In 2007, Nicaragua ranked at 90 in the Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum in Davos, rising to the rank of number five in 2019, only below the Nordic countries. The indigenous and Afro-descendant population of the Caribbean Coast and Upper Wanki River or Coco, achieved the delimitation and titling of 37,800 square kilometers of their ancestral lands, in 23 territories, each with its own territorial government and control of its own resources.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Nicaragua, like 35 other countries around the world, has seen its capacity to respond to climate change and to achieve sustainable development goals undermined by coercive, unilateral, extraterritorial and illegal measures, which even criminalize third parties that do not comply with the illegal measures. Only sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council are legal in international law. The international system of bank transfers is key to the de facto imposition of these illegal, unilateral, coercive measures that violate the human and legal rights of individuals, organizations and entire countries. There are also covert actions of destabilization of governments and attempts at coups d'état, some successful and others not. In the Middle East, several countries have been invaded or bombed in wars of aggression. The Nuremberg court ruled that this type of war is the supreme violation of international law and human rights, because it contains within it the sum of all the evils of war. Even countries suffering the consequences of climate change see their ability to respond to the future shattered by catastrophic disasters and the lack of international compensation mechanisms. All these phenomena have affected the respective response capacity of developing countries.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement are incomplete, because they do not include an effective mechanism to finance response and recovery of losses and damages. Mitigation reduces the risk of loss and damage; adaptation reduces the impact of specific threats of loss and damage; loss and damage themselves, are the end result of the very climate change we are seeking to minimize. Thus, we propose that the concept of losses and damages be elevated to the same level as mitigation and adaptation, in order to receive resources.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The President of Nicaragua, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, in his message to the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, stated that the only equitable and effective way to finance losses and damages is for the countries and corporations that have caused the problem and benefited from the use of carbon to accumulate capital to compensate countries that suffer the consequences of climate change without having caused it, in the proportion of their responsibility. We have the data from 1880 to date, both for countries and for corporations. Some people think this is a very radical proposal, but it is not. The concept that whoever causes damage to another must then compensate the other for the damage caused is called tort in common law. It is also in the Napoleonic codes and in Sharia law. So too, all ethical systems, and all religions of the world, contain the concept. However, the term most despised and feared in these negotiations is the word \"indemnification\".</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The developing countries need enormous financial resources for the future, to face mitigation, adaptation and losses and damages. In Copenhagen in 2009, funding of USD 100 billion per year starting in 2020 was proposed and reiterated in successive COPs. We should not accept as part of the US$100 billion accounts of past expenses, we cannot finance our projects with them. Nor can we accept that the market mechanisms of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement replace the US$100 billion annually. We must not accept the postponement of the date after having already waited 10 long years. What is needed from 2020 onwards are new, fresh, liquid resources with equal access for all developing countries. To guarantee these requisites, if these funds appear, they should be channeled through the financial mechanisms of the Convention, namely the Green Climate Fund, the GEF, the Adaptation Fund, and the Least Developed Countries Fund.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year 2019 will be remembered like 1848, 1871, 1968 and 1989, as a year when the street became important in world politics. Climate change is one of the drivers of this phenomenon in many countries, with youth on the front line. The 16-year-olds marching in the streets today will be 18 years old in two more years, and no one will speak of that youth as passive, disinterested and apolitical. A highly motivated voting youth can change the correlation of political forces in many countries, being decisive in countries now evenly split between opposing forces.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_\_</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is still a year before COP26 in 2020 but you see neither a working group advancing the US$100 billion a year nor a road map. Only Secretary General Antonio Guterres has asked President Emanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica to investigate the issue.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the US$100 billion annual commitment in 2020 is broken, this could be termed the Fraud of the Century. In reality, much more is needed and US$100 billion has to be just a starting point. The US$100 billion myth has the aggravating factor that it reduced climate change spending and action in the critical decade of 2010 to date, and now we are suffering the consequences. What we cannot do at this time is to have another Lost Decade of financing and action on Climate Change.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>More Than 1,200 People Leave Prison for Homes\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President Rosario Murillo announced on Dec. 20 that the prison sentences for various offenses of 1,292 prisoners (1,237 men, 55 women from 7 prisons) were reduced to house arrest and the prisoners were released to their families. This practice of family unification for the prisoner's reintegration into society, has been an annual practice of the Sandinista government during the holidays.

Two loans signed between the Government of Nicaragua and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE) were recently approved, one for US$333.8 million and the other for US$251.4 million, for the road improvement and expansion program and for drinking water and sanitation projects in seven cities. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Assembly President Gustavo Porras added, “Before 2007, there were 2,050 kilometers of highways in Nicaragua and today the country has 4,500 kilometers of highways.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Informe Pastran, 12/20/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>2019: Year of Legislation for Peace, Reconciliation, Stability and Harmony\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Carlos Emilio López, vice chair of the National Assembly Committee on Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs, and also the National Coordinator of the Reconciliation, Justice and Peace Commissions, said that during this legislative period the Law of Integral Attention to Victims was approved to support those who were affected by violence during the attempted coup that began on April 18, 2018. \"Seventy five hundred Commissions for Reconciliation, Justice and Peace were installed throughout the country. The law also establishes that this culture must be developed in all areas of socialization, that is, in the family, at school, in the workplace, in the communities, in the media, in order to create a culture of dialogue, of resolving conflicts through a method of good understanding,\" said the legislator.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law No. 996, the Amnesty Law, approved in June 2019, granted criminal pardon, judicial pardon and procedural pardon to all persons who committed criminal, common and political acts between 18 April 2018 and 10 June 2019, regardless of their political affiliation, according to López. He explained that this law included persons who \"were being investigated, who were being prosecuted, who had already received a conviction, or a court sentence saying they committed the crime of terrorism or theft or murder or rape or illegal possession of weapons or destruction of public and private property or arson. All these acts are defined in the Nicaraguan Criminal Code.\" He continued, \"Amnesty does not mean impunity, it does not mean a license to continue committing crimes.\_ If some of these people commit crimes again they will have to be subjected to processes of investigation, trial, sanction, fulfillment of sentence; they cannot commit criminal acts again.” He commented that 2019 was also a year of legislating for national dignity, nationalism, independence and sovereignty, which is why this legislative period declared May 4 as National Dignity Day, in recognition of the legacy of Augusto C. Sandino, “the General of Free Men and Women,” who maintained Nicaragua's dignity and decorum in the face of US occupation. (Informe Pastran, 12/20/19)</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Important Laws Approved in 2019\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the economic laws approved last year by the National Assembly was the Reform and Addition to Law 822, Law of Tax Concertation that ensured tax revenues will continue strengthening fiscal stability, employment generation and maintenance of social programs for poverty reduction. Another of the reforms that were approved was the Financial Analysis Unit (FAU) Act, which guarantees an institutional link of a legal nature between the FAU and the specialized unit in the judiciary, which would be created to receive reports of unusual operations generated by lawyers as subjects bound by the anti-money laundering law.

By November of 2019, 97.02% of electricity coverage was achieved, benefiting 3.1 million people with the installation of electricity service in 622,742 homes... \"Today we are pleased to inform our people that we exceeded the goal of 97%; this is data that exists and is accounted for in the distribution companies where they have legalized all the homes that are electrified,\" said Mansell, noting that the country will end the year with a coverage of 97.15%.\_ (informe Pastran, 12/20/19)\_</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Daily Mail Includes Nicaragua in List of 12 New Key Destinations for 2020\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicaragua was included in an exclusive list of 12 new key tourist destinations around the world, published on December 28 by the British newspaper \"Daily Mail\".
