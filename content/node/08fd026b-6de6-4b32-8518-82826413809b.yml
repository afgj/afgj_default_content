The FARC no longer exist and turned in their weapons, so it is time to show Colombians that their country belongs to them, not the U.S. We say let Trinidad's voice be heard in political campaigns in Colombia, instead of being silenced in the Colorado mountains.</span>\n\nWe are also demanding freedom for \"Sonia\" or Anayibe Rojas Valderrama, another FARC member imprisoned in Forth Worth, Texas.\n\nTrinidad is held in the Florence, Colorado supermax prison, in solitary confinement. Solitary confinement is a special type of torture. He is not even allowed to read our letters to him. Florence supermax is the \"Guantanamo of the Rockies\" where human rights are violated as a matter of policy. In 2015, thirty-five American activists, from nine states, held a march and rally outside the underground Colorado prison to demand freedom for Simon Trinidad.\n\nThere are still hundreds of FARC fighters held in prison and they need to be free to propel the Colombian peace process forward. The Colombian government must also act quickly to end the murders by right-wing militias tied to land owners and drug cartels. Laws must be enforced and impunity for police and soldiers brought to an end. For peace and reconciliation to succeed, those who were the most involved in the war need to be engaged in and publicly seen to support the processes. If there are long delays and changes in interpretations of the peace agreement, it breaks trust and confidence. What Simon Trinidad and most Colombians want is a political and legal system that belongs to Colombians and is not dominated or manipulated by foreign companies or governments.\n\nSimon Trinidad and \"Sonia\" are casualties of the Colombian peace process. It is time for President Trump to step up and support the changes coming to Colombia. If Trump frees Simon Trinidad and sends him home to promote the peace, it sends a message that Colombia's future lies in the hands of Colombians.\n\nCall Trump: <a href=\"tel:%28202%29%20456-1111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">202-456-1111</a> and say:\nWe want the President to Free Ricardo Palmera (Simon Trinidad)!\nWe want the President to Free Anayibe Rojas Valderrama (Sonia)!\nIt is Time for Trump to Step up for Peace!\n\n&nbsp;"
