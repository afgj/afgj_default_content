The\_threat of the NICA Act, though, does continue to look malignantly over\_the horizon, so let’s explore this week where economic relations stand\_between Washington and Managua.\n\nIn the US system, presidents present a proposed budget around this\_time of year. The budget should be understood as a political\_document, not a financial document. The US press is quick to declare\_the president’s budget “dead on arrival” no matter who the president is.\_Presidential budgets are already smelly and decomposing if the\_Congress is held by a party different from the president. But even\_though this year both branches of government are held by the\_Republican party, Trump’s inexperience and the radical changes\_proposed in his budget, probably make his budget just as much worm\_meat as Obama’s last six budgets after he lost congress in the first\_mid-term election of his presidency.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Trump won’t get anything he wants, but there\_are lots of steps to the spending process and there are economic\_interest groups defending every dollar in the budget and using\_campaign donations and other means to insure congressional support\_for their little space at the pig trough of public spending. Trump can’t\_just wave his hand and sweep the entrenched interests from the game\_board.\n\nIt is true that some areas of spending have more powerful economic\_and political interests defending them than others. Foreign aid may\_well be one of the least defended areas in the budget and therefore\_most vulnerable to cuts on the order of 50% which is what Trump is\_proposing overall. (Much deeper cuts for Nicaragua.) The question is\_whether that’s a bad thing.\n\nForeign aid has always been a tool to achieve US foreign policy\_objectives, but beginning with Reagan and increasing under each of\_his successors, Republican and Democrat alike, the money has been\_spent less and less on brick and mortar projects that were arguably of\_some benefit to the recipient country, and more and more on the mis-named “democracy promotion” funding of opposition groups and\_projects to destabilize the country and promote anti-democratic forces.\_So you won’t see me joining any campaign to “save foreign aid.” The\_published analysis by Nicaraguan leaders on the effect of US aid cuts\_reflects that US aid has actually become irrelevant to the Nicaraguan\_economy. That’s true not just because its focus has changed but\_because its level is already so low as to make no difference.\_Luxembourg, the smallest country in Europe sends more bilateral aid\_to Nicaragua annually than does the United States!\n\nPresidential economic advisor Bayardo Arce said that in the short term\_Nicaragua’s economy could withstand threats of reduced US aid, US\_protectionist moves, and even the NICA Act, if it passes. Arce pointed\_out that he’s not aware of any US aid actually going to the government\_of Nicaragua except maybe a little to the Army to fight the Drug War.\_Any other US aid is directed to civil society groups, the great majority\_of which oppose the Sandinista government.\n\nJose Adan Aguerri, president of the big business advocacy group,\_COSEP, said there is no reason for alarm because already the only\_countries [in Latin America] that still have substantial, though\_diminished, US aid, are those with direct migration problems such as\_Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti. “The rest of the\_countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, Uruguay, Paraguay,\_Nicaragua, have already seen aid cut to a minimum,” he said.\n\nOther business leaders echoed his remarks. Alvaro Rodriguez,\_president of American Chamber of Commerce of Nicaragua\_(AmCham) said, “For the moment I don’t consider it a cause for alarm.”\_Mario Arana, director of the Association of Producers and Exporters of\_Nicaragua (APEN) and former president of the Central Bank (BCN),\_said that President Trump's proposal was due to internal affairs in the\_US. \"In relation to Central America, they are more concerned with\_issues of security and migration. However, I think this [the proposed\_cuts] is preliminary and we still have to wait,\" he said.\n\nThe only concern was raised by Michael Healy, president of the Union\_of Agricultural Producers of Nicaragua (Upanic), who said that this\_decrease will affect the training of small Nicaraguan producers. \"This is\_definitely a blow to the small producers who have been trained with\_these funds,\" Healy said. If adopted by Congress, the Trump budget\_would cut aid to Nicaragua from the current US$10 million to a mere\_$200,000 which would have quite an impact on opposition political and\_civil society groups which lack support within their own country.\n\nWe should be clear that the NICA Act, which, if passed by both\_Houses of Congress and signed by the president, would require the\_US governors for the IMF, World Bank, and the Inter-American\_Development Bank to vote against multilateral loans to Nicaragua, is a\_much bigger threat than the cut in US aid, but perhaps, as Bayardo\_Arce indicated, not as big a threat as initially thought.\n\nThe Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act (H.R. 1819) took another\_small step forward when it was approved unanimously by the Western\_Hemispheric Affairs sub-committee of the House Foreign Affairs\_committee. That sets it up potentially for a hearing by the full\_committee. If passed there it would go to the Speaker of the House to\_put on the House calendar for a vote. When it is scheduled would\_depend on other legislative priorities such as the no-healthcare bill, tax\_reform, Trump’s Russia ties, etc.\n\nIf it should be voted on and approved by the House, it then goes\_through a similar process in the Senate. El Nuevo Diario says that the\_full Foreign Relations Committee of the House will take up the NICA\_Act in early June. That is possible, and that is what happened last Fall\_prior to the elections. What happened then is that it passed the full\_House by unanimous consent which means it wasn’t thought be the\_leadership of either party to be controversial. Members of Congress\_didn’t actually vote on it or even necessarily have any knowledge of it.\_It is important to be in touch with your Congresscritter to make sure\_they tell Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader, that the NICA Act is a bad\_bill and one that should not be passed on a unanimous consent\_docket. This is particularly important if you live in the Districts\_represented by Maxine Waters or Joaquin Castro who are leading\_Democrats on relevant committees and whose word alone to Pelosi\_would be enough to block the bill from unanimous consent.\n\nFormer Liberal Party Foreign Minister\_Francisco Aguirre Sacasa thinks that the House will pass the NICA Act in July, but didn’t know its prospects in the Senate. Congress normally goes on a long recess in August when temperatures and humidity in Washington, DC are at their most miserable. So, if the NICA Act is considered by the Senate, it will not be until Fall at the earliest.\n\nUS Ambassador Laura Dogu said that,\_in the hypothetical case that the NICA Act passes, the Trump administration will continue to work with the government and people of Nicaragua. “Our focus is prosperity, security, and democracy, working where we have interests in common…,” she said.\n\nAnd finally, it is not at all certain that the US, under Trump, will be able to maintain the effective veto power it has exercised before in the multilateral lending institutions. We reported a few weeks ago that the Inter-American Development Bank has changed its voting procedures so that the US no longer has the votes to block a loan by itself. In the IMF and World Bank, it never has, but other countries have deferred to the US giving it an effective veto. Given Trump’s alienation of European leaders in particular, I think there is a possibility that the US could no longer dictate decisions by the World Bank and IMF.\n\nNone of this is to imply that Nicaragua is not under a real threat and that it is our job to oppose US intervention just as we have for the last 38 years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>BRIEFS</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\_Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord has brought\_attention to the fact that only Nicaragua and Syria had not signed the\_Accord. Initial corporate media coverage tried to paint Trump as joining\_the “bad” company of Ortega and Assad, but surprisingly, coverage\_soon turned to truthful reporting that Syria was unable to attend the\_negotiations because of its civil war and Nicaragua, of all the nations\_of the world, refused to sign because the agreement was too weak to\_achieve its goals and the developed world was not held responsible for\_its historical contribution to climate change, as stated by Paul Oquist,\_Nicaragua’s chief climate change negotiator. Nicaragua is one of the\_nations most vulnerable to climate change. Oquist pointed out that the\_100 poorest countries only contribute 3% of carbon dioxide emissions.\_Nicaragua also already exceeds Paris targets with 50% of its electricity\_produced from renewable resources. (Informe Pastran, June 2)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>President Daniel Ortega continues to enjoy wide popular\_support in his 10th\_year in office. \_A Siglo Nuevo poll carried out\_between May 26-28, found that 80.4% of the Nicaraguan people\_expressed their support for the President. Seventy-nine percent said\_they approve of the way in which the government is being managed\_and 72.7% have\_a positive opinion of the Tripartite Alliance Model\_between government, employers and labor. The survey was based on\_interviews with 10,431 individuals nationwide. (Nicaragua News, June\_2)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Vice President Rosario Murillo announced the construction of\_a new US$20.6 million hospital in Bilwi, capital of the Northern\_Caribbean Autonomous Region (RACN). \"This is an important\_donation from the Netherlands that will provide greater coverage and\_better healthcare services to the Nicaraguan people,\" Murillo said.\_(Nicaragua News, June 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Mario Amador, president of the National Sugar Producers\_Committee, announced that production of energy using sugarcane\_waste totaled 620.4 million kilowatt-hours during the 2016-2017\_harvest season, a 15.5% increase above the amount recorded in the\_previous year. He added that greater electricity generation is being\_projected due to an increase in sugar production which is expected to\_reach 17 million hundredweights during the 2017-2018 harvest.\_(Nicaragua News, June 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>On May 31, a plane landed in Managua with 26 men deported\_from the United States. They brought to 280 the total of Nicaraguan\_migrants deported since\_Jan. 1, a small fraction of the number\_deported to Nicaragua’s northern neighbors. The men had been\_detained in different states. The Nicaraguan government provided\_them with medical attention and help to return to their places of origin\_outside the capital, services that are not commonly provided to\_returnees in the other Central American countries.
