What policies are being promoted under the name of gender equality and women’s rights? Since the mid-1980s there has been an opening in Mexico’s political and electoral process that has promoted the participation of women in the political life of the nation. This unprecedented participation of women coincides with the economic and political climate that prompted Mexico to adopt neoliberal policies, sign free trade agreements and increase democratization. The United States has had a crucial role in the institutions and policies that Mexico has created as a consequence of this economic and political climate. This role is seen in the interests that are defended through neoliberalism and NAFTA, but also in the funding of organizations that promote women’s political participation. This workshop compares the women’s voices that have gained access to political participation with the voices of women’s grassroots activism that continue to be left out of the political life. It also offers an analysis of the set of policies being promoted through women who have taken advantage of the opportunity to participate in the political process and how the policies relate to the struggle of women in grassroots activism.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ <b><i>Organization: Alliance for Global Justice—Presenter: Ana Gabriela Caballeros—Tracks: Latin America Solidarity, US political intervention</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>An Open Discussion on Border Militarization, the Migrant Experience, and Creating a Community Response</b>\r\n\r\nThis workshop will be a collective discussion involving both the presenters and attendees to have a conversation about the pervasive problem of misinformation that is being perpetuated by the media, political players and mainstream immigrant rights groups.\_ What is the reality being experienced on the border by affected communities?\_ What are the true impacts of militarized communities, enforcement strategies, and the thousands of deaths and missing migrants that are the direct results of U.S. border policies?\_ And most importantly, how do we, as directly affected communities and those acting in alliance, create a collective response that speaks our truths while trying to create meaningful change?\_ This workshop seeks to create a space for this discussion, using both contemporary border research currently being done as well as grassroots discussion that invites all present to discuss a strategy for lasting border justice. <b><i>Organization: Various organizations and affiliations—Presenters: Daniel Martinez, Robin Reineke, Kat Rodriguez, Jeremy Slack, Murphy Woodhouse—Tracks:\_ Immigrant Power</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Abolish Corporate Personhood</b>\r\n\r\nCorporate lawyers use the illegitimate, court-created doctrine of \"corporate personhood\" to overturn democratically enacted laws designed to protect the environment, workers, public health and safety. The equally odious, also illegitimate doctrine that \"money equals speech\" prevents meaningful campaign finance reform. Together, these doctrines steal our sacred right to self-government, and then use the Constitution to legalize the theft. Move To Amend is a concrete campaign to help build a multi-racial social movement to fundamentally alter the basic law of the United States. <b><i>Organization: Move To Amend (MTA) - Presenters: David Cobb, Spokesperson of MTA and Jerome Scott, League of Revolutionaries for a New America (LRNA). Tracks: Economic Justice, Poor People Power,\r\nDemocracy</i></b>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b><i>\_</i></b></p>\r\n<b>Artful Activism: Grand Strategy &amp; Creative Tactics</b>\r\n\r\nDelivering victories requires an understanding of how vision, goals, strategy and tactics relate to each other, the importance of values-based identity and sympathetic messaging for expanding alliances.\_ This workshop is an interactive presentation on Grand Strategy, domains of conflict, and how social movement power is built through a variety of modes of engagement, \"sectors of agency.\"\_\_ Participants will explore a spectrum of Creative Tactics from spectacle imagery to light projection to giant banners to nonviolent direct action as tools for growing your group, mobilizing your community, earning media attention, and shifting power. This workshop will be led by Bill Moyer a co-founder and director of the Backbone Campaign.\_ Over the past 10 years, Bill has designed and led hundreds of actions and trainings across the US. <b><i>Organization: http://BackboneCampaign.org – Presenter: \_Bill Moyer—Tracks: Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Black Power, Queer Justice, Immigrant Power, Poor People Power, Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Latin America Solidarity, Occupy Movement , Mideast Solidarity , Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism , Labor, Grand Strategy</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Bhopali' Film Screening</b>\r\n\r\nThe Bhopal gas disaster (1984) is the world’s worst industrial disaster. Caused by the use of untested technology and hazardous conditions in a pesticide manufacturing plant owned by the American-owned Union Carbide Corporation (now owned by the Dow Chemical Company), the Bhopal gas disaster is a telling account of the impact of neoliberal-driven development. However, most are unaware that the Bhopal gas disaster is an ongoing, and in many ways, a growing chemical disaster. The film, 'Bhopali' details this ongoing disaster, with particular focus on the impact on the second-generation. This includes the birth of children with developmental disabilities and congenital malformations attributed to their parents’ exposure. The film also details the resolve of survivors, who have sustained a soon-to-be 30 year struggle for justice. This makes their struggle one of the longest running anti-toxic grassroots movements in history --a struggle that is still going strong! <b><i>Organization: The International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal, North America (ICJB-NA) – Presenters: Sanjay Verma, a survivor-activist from Bhopal – Tracks: Economic Justice, Poor People Power, Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Breaking the Chains of Modern Day Slavery</b>\r\n\r\nWe will discuss how prisons serve as tools of oppression. We will show how policing and prisons target communities of color despairingly. We will also talk about prisons and how they destroy the fundamental right to family. We will share our experience as coming to this work and these realizations through surviving incarceration. We will highlight how central anti-prison work and this organization were to creating change in our individual lives and how we continue to connect with those inside. We will cover re-entry, policy, medical advocacy, and the scope of the work we do as a coalition and tie it to national and international movements for equality and justice. <b><i>Organization: California Coalition Women Prisoners – Presenters: Samantha Rogers and Misty Rojo – Tracks: Prison Abolition</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Building Multi-issue Coalitions</b>\r\n\r\nSystemic, progressive change has always been thwarted by patterns of domination built upon ranking hierarchies and the myth of disconnection. Building the new requires, and means becoming practiced at, non-hierarchical organization, communication, leadership, and decision making. Coalition building is also integral to systemic change, as it is a core requirement for building critical mass. To be successful, multi-issue coalitions must have a common goal congruent with a set of shared values, a process to discover their commonalities, and discover how their work fits into a comprehensive framework that supports moving toward that goal based on those values. For systemic, progressive change to be sustainable, it must be built from ecological integrity, social justice, economic equity, and participatory democracy. This workshop will address all of these issues, but especially their interrelated nature, how to actually put it into practice, and a brief overview of the evidence supporting how quickly it can be accomplished--by actual humans here on Earth. <b><i>Organization:</i></b> <b><i>Coalitions of Mutual Endeavor\_ - Presenters: Dave Ewoldt, Allison Ewoldt – Tracks: Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism , Systemic progressive change</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Cointelpro Then and Now</b>\r\n\r\nWe will view Cointelpro 101 for the first hour and then use the film to launch a discussion about government repression, historically and now.\_ COINTELPRO may not be a well-understood acronym but its meaning and continuing impact are absolutely central to understanding the US government’s wars and repression against progressive movements. COINTELPRO is both a formal program of the FBI and a term frequently used to describe a conspiracy among government agencies—local, state, and federal—to destroy movements for self-determination and liberation for Black, Brown, Asian, and Indigenous struggles. <b><i>Organization: Freedom Archives—Presenters: Stan Smith—Tracks</i></b><b><i>: Black Power, Immigrant Power, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism ,\_ Anti-repression</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Community Economics Roundtable - Creative Organizing\_ for Building Local Equity</b>\r\n\r\nBuilding power in our communities requires plugging the leaks of human and natural resources and redirecting the flow of equity back into a local economy.\_\_ Learn about and share creative organizing strategies to redirect community wealth back into communities and keep it there.\_ Learn how the Backbone Campaign helped establish a credit union branch in its community.\_ Learn how they negotiated a win/win agreement that put community members on the board, moved nearly $30 million out of Wall Street banks and into the local credit union to make energy efficiency loans to save people money on their power bills and employ local contractors. How are you building your local economy?\_ What is your creative organizing strategy that others can learn from and replicate? <b><i>Organization:</i></b> <b><i>http://BackboneCampaign.org – Presenters: Bill Moyer present and then facilitates a discussion amongst participants—Tracks: Economic Justice, Community Economics</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Conflict Resolution</b>\r\n\r\nThis workshop will explore the sources of conflict and present information on how to transform negative energy into more productive outcomes for those who encounter conflict in their personal, social, and/or professional roles. <b><i>Organization: Occupy Tucson – Presenters: Mary DeCamp, BA, MA – Tracks: Occupy Movement</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Confronting the U.S. War Drive</b>\r\n\r\nLearn how the insatiable need for profits inevitably leads to war and how, during times of capitalist economic crisis, the dangers of reckless and costly military adventures are further increased. Learn tactics and strategies for forging a united anti-war movement that opposes U.S. Imperialist intervention and occupations. <b><i>Organization: International Action Center— Presenters: Sara Flounders, Paul Teitelbaum—Tracks: Anti-Militarism , Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Criminality and Responses to State Repression</b>\r\n\r\nWe hope to initiate a conversation exploring how attitudes and perceptions of criminality and legitimacy affect responses to state repression. We will briefly look at recent responses to the use of grand juries to target both social movements and targeted communities and try to discern what made these responses effective. We strongly encourage people engaged in anti-repression work and movements against state violence to attend and share! <b><i>Organization: Tucson Anarchist Black Cross— Presenters: Tucson Anarchist Black Cross—Tracks: </i></b><b><i>Anti-Repression</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Cuba and ALBA</b>\r\n\r\nPanel discussion describing the realities of Cuba today and its relationship with the Bolivarian Alternative for Our Americas (ALBA). We will cover the development of Revolutionary Cuba, The effects of the US Embargo and Travel Ban, The case of the Cuban Five, and The regional groupings - ALBA. We also hope to foster new solidarity activities with/for Cuba. <b><i>Organization: National Network on Cuba—Presenter: Cheryl La Bash as moderator, and others—Tracks: Economic Justice, Latin America Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism , Cuba </i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Decolonization Skill Share</b>\r\n\r\nPrimarily intended for people of European heritage but useful to all people exploring decolonization , this skill-share moves beyond theory and explores the practical and deep process of finding ancestors, discovering Indigenous thought and philosophy, regaining a lost sense of place and lifeway, and most critically – the liberating process of healing our hearts and spirits so that we may find our way back to our Indigenous selves and create healing with those facing colonization.\_ This is real information taught using western and traditional styles that has the power to unsettle and change your life. <b><i>Organization: Lakota Solidarity Project—Presenters: Naomi Archer (Ana Oian Amets)—Tracks: Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism , Decolonization</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Elections Unparalleled</b>\r\n\r\nVenezuela has the best elections in the world. If this sentence shocks you as being ridiculous come and hear from people who have actually been there and observed their elections. The propaganda against Venezuela is downright Orwellian in nature. The truth is that the country's electoral system is shockingly innovative in its ability to create a democracy that encourages high turnout, informed voters and a near flawless transparent voting system. Skeptics beware, after hearing the truth your entire world view may be shattered as well as your faith in the US corporate media. <b><i>Organization: Alliance for Global Justice—Presenters: Bruce Wilkinson—Tracks: Poor People Power, Occupy Movement , Anti-Imperialism , Labor</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Exposing War Crimes is Not a Crime: Chelsea Manning &amp; GI Resistance</b>\r\n\r\nWithin discussions around U.S. militarization and imperialism, one voice often overlooked is that of active service members themselves who experience radical changes in conscience during deployment. Drawing on this summer's trial of army whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, and the history of conscientious objectors, we will explore this crucial element of effective resistance to the military-industrial complex and abusive foreign policy. <b><i>Organization: Courage to Resist—Presenters: Michael McKee, Farah Muhsin al-Mousawi—Tracks: Anti-Militarism , Mideast Solidarity , Anti-Imperialism , whistle-blowers</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>The Fat &amp; the Furious</b>\r\n\r\nRegardless of their expressed rejection of societal norms and beauty standards, activist and feminist communities are often hostile to fat people. In this workshop, we will discuss fat within the realms of bodily autonomy, identity, patriarchy, capitalism and the media, privilege, and the medical field. As a community, we can benefit from unlearning oppressive ideas and behaviors so we can better support each other. <b><i>Organization: Tucson Anti-Authoritarian Network – Presenters: Lauren, Adelaide, Lizzy, Corey – Tracks: Feminism, Gender</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Freedom According to the Zapatistas: Lessons from the Escuelita of August 2013</b>\r\n\r\nThe Zapatista Movement for indigenous rights in Chiapas, Mexico, led the fight against NAFTA and neoliberalism with its 1994 rebellion. Since then, the Zapatistas have been quietly building autonomy as they resist persistent attacks. Recently they began inviting their supporters to attend a one-week Escuelita de Libertad Segun L@s Zapatistas (\"Little School of Freedom According to the Zapatistas\"). The Escuelita includes home stays in Zapatista communities in which solidarity activists learn indigenous practices of agriculture, family life, self-government, and autonomous education and health care. The first round of the Escuelita was held in August, 2013, and more activists have been invited to attend two sessions in December and January. We will report our experiences as students in the first Escuelita, and share some of the lessons we learned. Through the workshop, we plan to apply these lessons to the struggles to tear down walls in our own communities and around the world. <b><i>Organization: Chiapas Support Committee of Oakland – Presenters: Todd Davies, Carolina Dutton – Tracks: Ecological Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>From a War Economy to a Peace Economy - the Challenge of Economic Conversion</b>\r\n\r\nMillions of workers in the U.S. are employed by the military-industrial-security complex. What are the steps we must take to move the country from a war and military-dependent economy to a sustainable demilitarized economy? How do we engage those whose jobs and incomes depend on the war economy to participate in charting a course to a new economic order rather than resisting changes needed to dismantle the war machine? How can we protect them and their communities from becoming road kill on the road to demilitarizing our economy? What lessons can be learned from the environmental movement's efforts to move the country from a carbon-based to a sustainable alternative economy? This workshop will tackle these and related questions to prepare activists to engage their communities in this conversation. <b><i>Organization: U.S. Labor Against the War (USLAW), New Priorities Network – Presenters: Michael Eisenscher, National Coordinator, USLAW – Tracks: Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Environmental Justice, Anti-Imperialism , Labor</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Global Climate Change and the Initiative process</b>\r\n\r\nRoland James has experience with energy issues, including 14 years as assistant to an Arizona utility regulator, and with statewide Initiatives, including the 1970s Nuclear Safeguards Initiatives, \_which changed the public dialogue about nuclear power and helped prevent further nuclear proliferation and the building of 1000 nuclear plants in the US by 2000. \_Now fossil fuels and Global Climate Pollution are the overwhelming problem of our time. \_ The Initiative process is available in 22 states--almost all the western states except NM, Ks, and Tx and in Maine, Mass, Ohio, Michigan, Ark, and Missouri. \_ The purpose of Initiatives now is to educate and build a much bigger movement and constituency for U.S. and International action for all global carbon-based energy. \_One possible Initiative is a carbon fee with dividend returned 100% equally (benefits low-use and low-income). \_Initiative also could include Net Metering for all and seamless financing of efficiency, weatherization, and rooftop solar. \_ A carbon tax or fee and dividend mirrors Dr. James Hansen’s approach. \_China, India and the developing world have opposed Cap and Trade as Eco-imperialism and the turning over the Global Atmospheric Commons to Wall Street. \_However, they have indicated that they would accept an international carbon tax/fee adjusted for the economies of each country. \_If they are around, will our\_grandchildren ask: \_“Why didn’t we (humanity) save ourselves when we had the chance? \_ \_Over half this workshop will be discussion. \_<b><i>Organization: Hope for Climate Change—Presenters: Roland James—Tracks: Environmental Justice</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Guatemalan Genocide Case: Tearing Down the Walls of Impunity</b>\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 2013, Former President Efraín Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 80 years in prison. The conviction marked the culmination of 12 years of dedication and determination by a national organization of survivors, the Association for Justice and Reconciliation (AJR), and their legal team, the Center for Human Rights Legal Action. Just 10 days later, Guatemala's highest court, the Constitutional Court, overturned the historic sentence, exposing Guatemala's legacy of impunity and the deeply rooted power structures which have undermined the will of the survivors and the integrity of the legal process. In this workshop, Don Anselmo Rodan, a survivor of a massacre in his own community, will present a workshop on the long and arduous road toward justice in Guatemala. As the AJR stated before the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues immediately following the Constitutional Court annulment: \"Today, more than ever, it is imperative we continue to demand justice and face the past to ensure acts of genocide never again take place in Guatemala... As long as this does not happen, the state will continue to deny our rights and facilitate the dispossession of the lands and natural resources that are fundamental to the material and spiritual life of indigenous peoples. Brothers and sisters: we must stop the continuation of genocide in Guatemala.\" <b><i>Organization: NISGUA – Presenters: Anselmo Rodan, Ellen Moore – Tracks: Anti-Militarism , Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Latin America Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Guatemala Rises Up: Resistance to Mega-Development Projects</b>\r\n\r\nGuatemala has been historically pillaged by foreign exploitation of its natural resources. Most recently, Free Trade Agreements have allowed the US and other powers to invest heavily in extractive industries in the country, particularly in the rapidly-growing mining and hydroelectric sectors. The consequences for local communities and their natural environment have been disastrous as the projects have contributed to human rights violations, displacement, destruction of ecosystems, and economic inequalities. But communities are resisting—organizing creatively and demanding protection of their social, political and environmental rights. Come learn about the impacts of multinational investment in Guatemala, how networks of activists are supporting community resistance to the exploitation of their lands and how you can get involved. <b><i>Organization: Guatemala Human Rights Commission/USA—Presenters: Kathryn Johnson—Tracks: Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, Latin America Solidarity</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Health in US Funded Colombian Prisons - A talk about prisons as an absolute Social Determinant of Health</b>\r\n\r\nWhile US funding and the restructuring of Colombian prisons has been justified as a way of alleviating overcrowding and improving conditions, the effect, and direct consequence of \"Prison Imperialism,\" has been the opposite. Colombian prisons including those funded by US tax dollars, continuously deny prisoners their basic rights to health and their constitutional right to life. Overcrowding, limited access to clean water, reoccurring TB outbreaks, and the denial of health care services through the privatized prison health care insurance system, forces Colombian families to bear with the sole responsibility of the basic and catastrophic health care needs of their imprisoned loved ones.\r\n\r\nThe presenter will draw parallels between Colombia, Mexico, and Arizona, as the reality of these three regions, perfectly illustrate how prisons, again and again, are what determine the state of physical and mental health of not only the individual who is imprisoned, but their children, and the entire family.\r\n<b><i>Organization: Alliance for Global Justice—Presenters: Frida Espinosa Cárdenas, MPH, Former Health Program Evaluator, Member of the Latin American Association of Social Medicine, ALAMES, and member of AFGJ's Colombia working group, Raquel Mogollón, who got an inside look at Colombia's most notorious prison, La Tramacúa, built with US taxes.—Tracks: Poor People Power, Latin America Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Honduras: The Struggle for Democracy, Human Rights, and the Environment</b>\r\n\r\nSince the June 28, 2009 military coup against the government of Honduras, systematic and serious repression is an ongoing reality for the people of this impoverished country. The Honduran elites – primarily the oligarchy and U.S. and Canadian corporations that have long controlled the economic, political and social reality in this country – are responsible for these abuses. In response, the Honduran people – students, teachers, artists, lawyers, journalists, indigenous groups, LGBT community, campesinos (farmers), environmentalists, and labor organizations – have established a unifying coalition and a political party, Libertad y Refundacion (LIBRE) that is challenging the dominant powers in Honduras in an election to be held on November 24th. This workshop will provide information about the election, the role of the U.S. and Canadian governments and corporations in legitimizing and benefiting from the military coup, and about the courage and spirit of Honduras’ peaceful pro-democracy movement. <b><i>Organization: Marin Interfaith Task Force on the Americas, Honduras Solidarity Network – Presenters: Mark Sullivan and Rick Sterling – Tracks: Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Environmental Justice, Latin America Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How the Meek can inherit the Earth; Creating the New Paradigm</b>\r\n\r\nAfter 40 years of mulling this over, the presenter has concluded that real power comes primarily from economics; duh!\_ Not the Wall Street kind but being able to provide food, shelter, healthcare, etc. for ourselves and, over time, to whoever wants/needs it.\_ And if we want to live on a peaceful, just, harmonious, sustainable, healthy planet, we are going to have to create that reality ourselves.\_ I mean, who is going to do it for us? Who would you trust to do it for you?\_ The thesis is that we have all the skills and resources necessary to do that.\_ What we lack are the focus and commitment and the ability to work effectively together (although we are getting better at it).\_ Once we get to the point where we can give people an option to how they currently obtain these basics of life than those who don't like it but feel they have to feed the current system can quit doing that and feed a more righteous system.\_ After a time, the more righteous system makes the old system obsolete!\_ Yay! <b><i>Organization: Creating the New Paradigm— Presenters: Jack Strasburg—Tracks: Anti-Militarism, Black Power, Queer Justice, Immigrant Power, Poor People Power, Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Latin American Solidarity, and Community Building</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Imperialism, Ecology and the Green Economy</b>\r\n\r\nThe Green Economy was officially unveiled at the United Nations' Rio+20 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012.\_ It was developed to enable Capitalism and business as usual to continue as long as possible beyond all natural limits.\_ It is designed to enable corporations and the 1% to profit from global crises including the climate crisis, food and water crises, biodiversity crisis and economic crisis.\_ This workshop will explore the Green Economy and its plans in depth and discuss what is being done about it around the world. <b><i>Organization: Global Justice Ecology Project — Presenters: Anne Petermann, Jacqui Patterson —Tracks: </i></b><b><i>Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Latin America Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Indigenous Rights &amp; Sovereignty</b>\r\n\r\nOur workshop will focus on ecological, economic and social injustices.\_ Specifically dealing with the desecration and degradation of our Mother Land. We will discuss the systems that support and promote the disconnect between our traditional values and beliefs to that of the dominate society including education. Lastly, we will discuss Policies of Genocide imposed on our people by internal and external forces. <b><i>Organization: Purpose Focused Alternative Learning—Presenters: Don Yellowman - Forgotten Navajo People Organization, Janene Yazzie - Sixth World Solutions—Tracks: Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Introducing non-hierarchical tools for organizing, communicating, sharing leadership, and group decisions</b>\r\n\r\nProven processes and methodologies for non-hierarchical organization, planning and running events and meetings, interpersonal and group communication, and basic democratic group decision making--all congruent with natural systems principles. Expend less energy and achieve better results by working with the life-affirming principles of the natural world, such as the tendencies to self-organize into relationships of mutual support, and increase diversity. <b><i>Organization: Coalitions for Mutual Endeavor – Presenters: Dave Ewoldt, Allison Ewoldt – Tracks:</i></b> <b><i>Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Poor People Power, Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Occupy Movement , Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism , Labor, Sustainability</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Is Peace with Justice within Reach in Colombia?</b>\r\n\r\nThe Marcha Patriótica is the largest popular Left organization in Colombia advocating for peace with justice and popular participation in negotiations to end the armed and social conflicts in Colombia.\_ The Alliance for Global Justice and the National Lawyers Guild were the two US organizations represented at the installation of the Marcha Patriótica in April, 2012, and for years, AfGJ was the only US organization with a solidarity relation with the Fensuagro agricultural workers union--one of the world's most targeted labor organizations.\_ Come hear representatives from Colombia's Marcha Patriótica as well as the AfGJ and NLG give an informative presentation about the prospects for peace in Colombia today. <b><i>Organization: AfGJ—Presenters:\_ Diego Martínez, Coordinator of the Comité Permanente en Defensa de los Derechos Humanos and member of the Executive Committee of the Marcha Patriótica, Mark Burton, National Lawyers Guild, Raquel Mogollón, Alliance for Global Justice and Pan Left, Frida Cárdenas, Alliance for Global Justice—Tracks: Anti-Militarism , Poor People Power, Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity, Latin America Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism , Labor</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Learn practices for active Peace</b>\r\n\r\n(CCP) workshop: (1)Throughout the workshop we practice reflection, spiritual interfaith thoughts.(2)Exploring roots and nature of violence.

But the United States Government has used various tactics to slow the project down and other factors have contributed to its results.\_ This workshop will use videos, photos and discussion to share the lessons learned from the project which are critical to activists and groups seeking solidarity with Indigenous resistance. <b><i>Organization: Lakota Solidarity Project—Presenters: Naomi Archer, Christine Blachly—Tracks: Economic Justice, Poor People Power, Ecological Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>\_</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Meaning of the Economic-Political Changes in Cuba Under the Unrelenting U.S. Blockade</b>\r\n\r\nThe economic changes taking place in Cuba are often painted as a movement away from socialism. Today, Cuba is recognized as a world leader in education, medical care, women's rights, organic farming, and environmentally sustainable economy. Popular participation in the revolution has been deepening, in part inspired the democratic movements in power in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia. Yet the US blockade of Cuba, instituted 50 years ago, designed to crush the Cuban people by destroying their economy, remains firmly in place and has even worsened. Four of the Cuban 5, despite support from the UN Human Rights Commission, and even Amnesty International, remain in US prisons for exposing CIA-Miami terrorism against Cuba. <b><i>Organization: Chicago Committee to Free the Cuban 5 – Presenters: Stan Smith – Tracks: Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Environmental Justice, Latin America Solidarity</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Native History Under Attack</b>\r\n\r\nThis workshop will provide a youth-led perspective on how Palestinian solidarity intertwines with local organizing around a high-profile movement to save ethnic studies, under fire in Arizona. The moderated discussion will cover how issues of Palestine solidarity developed in the Tucson youth’s local organizing, from meeting with Palestinian youth-education activists, writing/publishing educational materials (articles, handouts, etc.), giving joint presentations on cross-movement connections, and holding internal political education workshops focusing on Palestinian justice. <b><i>Organization: Students for Justice in Palestine, University of Arizona chapter—Presenters: Gabriel M.

This workshop will examine the possible impacts of this project on the environment (including negative ones on Lake Nicaragua and positive ones on the rainforests essential to the provision of water for the canal). The traditional lives of Indigenous groups would also be impacted. President Daniel Ortega, whose record on anti-poverty programs has won widespread praise, says that the profits and jobs from the project, which also includes ports, a railroad and an oil pipeline, will be enough to lift Nicaragua out of poverty.

This workshop will introduce participants to the six principles and six steps of Kingian Nonviolence and review eight things to remember when organizing nonviolent direct action campaigns. As Gandhi, King, and Chavez all stressed, the means you use must reflect the end you want to achieve. To successfully defend human rights, we must utilize a methodology that enhances the humanity of everyone involved, no matter what side of the conflict they represent. This is much easier said than done. It is so tempting to demonize the “enemy”. However, the goal of nonviolence is to achieve justice –not to defeat or humiliate your opponent. We will review several key aspects of nonviolence including: non-cooperation with unjust laws; preventing wrongs from happening; negotiation and direct action to bring about specific changes; and constructive programs or “acting out the future” in terms of creating social structures that help build the “beloved community”…a community that supports <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">all</span> people in reaching their highest potential. <b><i>Organization: Nonviolence Legacy Project (NVLP) – Presenters: Ann Yellott, Hassan Clement, Cruz Verdugo &amp; possibly other members of the NVLP Youth Crew – Tracks: Economic Justice, Anti-Militarism , Black Power, Queer Justice, Immigrant Power, Poor People Power, Environmental Justice, Occupy Movement , Mideast Solidarity, Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Occupy Intentional Communities</b>\r\n\r\nIt is difficult if not impossible to tear down a corrupt system when you rely on it for your daily bread.\_ There are literally thousands of people with values very similar to Occupiers trying to build Intentional Communities who have land, skills and other needed resources.\_ Often they lack the people power to get it done.\_ Occupiers could provide that people power and build a viable alternative economic structure that could offer an option to those trapped in the current system.\_ The less one relies on the current mainstream system the less power it has over you.\_ This may be the most effective way to diminish the power of the dominate system and build a peaceful, just, harmonious, healthy planet. <b><i>Organization: Creating the New Paradigm—Presenters: Jack Strasburg—Tracks: Economic Justice, Poor People Power, Ecological Solidarity, Occupy Movement , Anti-Imperialism , Community Building</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Operation Streamline: What is it?

The infamous Guantanamo prison is another example of the internationalization of the US model. This model was largely developed in the US and in Colombia, where the US funded and advised some of the country's most notorious prisons, and where political prisoners are concentrated. In Mexico, the US is funding construction of 16 new federal prisons, and personnel are being trained by both US and Colombian officials. The export of this model constitutes a kind of \"prison imperialism\". But even more, \"prison imperialism\" refers to the explicit role played by US spending internationally on jail construction, border militarization and expanded police forces and powers. Together these reinforce the hold of US power and influence around the world. <b><i>Organization: Alliance for Global Justice – Presenters: James Jordan, Nat’l Co-Coordinator, AfGJ – Tracks: Latin America Solidarity, Imperialism, Prison Justice</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Public Banking</b>\r\n\r\nThrough a power point presentation and discussion, the workshop could explore how credit is created.

All of us contribute to the reality that people of color, especially young men of color, encounter daily examples of racial profiling…when sales people follow them around in stores, an older woman clutches her purse and moves away from them in an elevator, people cross the street apparently to avoid interacting with them, or a school monitor or teacher uses disrespectful language in addressing them. These constant reminders that people are judging you and making negative assumptions solely on the basis of your skin color and racial identity does harm to everyone involved. Racial profiling obviously harms the individuals who are the recipients of repeated negative assumptions. Less obvious is the damage done to people practicing such dehumanization of others and those of us who may witness such discrimination as “bystanders” without intervening. In this workshop, we will hear personal stories from youth and adults who have experienced such racial profiling, acknowledge the harm done, and explore empowering actions they have taken and each of us might take to make a positive difference in eliminating\_ racial profiling/racism. <b><i>Organization: Nonviolence Legacy Project— Panel Members: James Stubbs Jr., Hassan Clement, Becky Hall, others—Tracks: Black Power, Queer Justice, Immigrant Power, Indigenous Solidarity, discrimination/racism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Refusing to fight in Afghanistan - Organizing inside the military against war</b>\r\n\r\nLast year, veterans and active-duty troops launched a campaign called \"Our Live, Our Rights,\" which had the simple message: \"don't go to Afghanistan.\" They have distributed thousands of leaf-lets on military bases calling on U.S. troops to refuse to fight in Afghanistan, with information on why they should, why they have the right, and how they will be supported.

WORTH builds and strengthens leadership skills amongst its members to assist them in navigating these challenges and impact the political decisions that affect our lives. By sharing our stories, WORTH members seek to change public policies and perceptions of women who have been impacted by the criminal justice system. WORTH was instrumental in limiting the shackling of pregnant women in New York State. Formerly incarcerated women spoke about being pregnant while in jail and prison, being handcuffed and shackled while in labor, and being separated from their newborn babies almost immediately. The power of women's individual stories to enact change is powerful.

In this workshop, Doctress Neutopia will move through the history of architecture and begin planning for a positive future by constructing a new evolutionary architectural design, arcology that fuses together architecture and ecology.

Since the beginning of the second Palestinian uprising started in 2000, over 20,000 prisoners, men, women, and children have been coming in and out of Israeli prisons. Based on my work over the past 10 years with Palestinian refugee youth in different refugee camps in the West Bank, I have witnessed a dramatic change in the demography of the refugee camps, in large part due to the high level of imprisonment among youth. The age of arrest varies; youth may be detained or arrested anytime between ages 11 to 25 years old. Many of those children and young men and women have no knowledge of interrogation techniques in interrogation centers. Not only do these youth miss out on their education, they leave prison with many psychological problems due to harsh interrogations and bad prison environment. We'll be using short films and photographs to present these issues. \_<b><i>Organization: Lajee Center – Presenters: Nidal Al-Azraq, Mohammad Al-Azza – Tracks: Poor People Power, Mideast Solidarity , Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Walmart: Driving down wages around the world!</b>\r\n\r\nAs the largest private employer in the world, Walmart is setting the standard for jobs. Hundreds of thousands of its employees live in poverty—even many that work full time. That includes workers in subcontracted warehouses and workers in developing countries making incredibly low wages while manufacturing the goods on Walmart’s shelves. This pulls down standards for workers around the globe.\_Across this country, in rural and suburban communities, there are too many small businesses to count who have closed their doors due to unfair competition from Walmart. Now, Walmart has aggressively set its sights on large urban communities like New York City and Los Angeles. The company is a major contributor to the widening gap between the very rich and everyone else. The average full time Walmart “associate” makes about $15,500 a year and Walmart is pushing more workers toward a permanent part-time status. Meanwhile, the six members of the Walton family have a combined wealth of $93 billion. That’s more than the bottom 30% of Americans combined. Learn about the campaign anchored by the UFCW Union that brings Walmart workers, community organizations and ordinary citizens together to make a change! <b><i>Organization: United Food and Commercial Workers Union--Presenters: Jamie Way, Making Change at Walmart Campaign, and Katherine Hoyt, Alliance for Global Justice--Tracks: Economic Justice, Immigrant Power, Poor People Power, Labor.</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What's Behind the Drug War in Mexico and Central America?</b>\r\n\r\nThe objective of this workshop is to provide information about the Drug War in Mexico and Central America and to look at what is behind this war, the possible motives and connections to US policy. We also hope to make connections between the Drug War in the US and issues of immigration and the criminal \"justice\" system to be explored in the large peoples power assembly with an eye toward the possibility of a bi-national (or more) movement. <b><i>Organization: Latin America Solidarity Coalition Drug War Working Group – Presenters: Prof. Laura Carlsen and others – Tracks: Drug War, Latin America Solidarity</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s Going On In Syria?</b>\r\n\r\nThe highlight of this workshop will be a presentation by Mother Agnes-Mariam, Mother Superior at the Monastery and Convent of St. James in Qara, Syria. \_She is coming directly from the Middle East and\r\nstarting her North America Tour at the Tear Down the Walls Conference. Mother Agnes will present her \"on the ground\" observations and experiences in Syria. She says that much Western reporting on Syria is\r\ninaccurate, false and even fabricated. \_Mother Agnes has launched the Mussalaha Initiative seeking nonviolent resolution and reconciliation in Syria. <b><i>Organization: Syria Solidarity Movement and Mussalaha (Reconciliation) Movement—Presenters: Mother Agnes-Mariam of the Cross \_with support from Syria Solidarity Movement and ANSWER—Tracks: Mid-East Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Who are the Political Prisoners in the US</b>\r\n\r\nWe give an overview of the different political prisoner cases and their defense campaigns: Bradley (Chelsea) Manning, Lynne Stewart, Leonard Peltier, Cuban 5, Mumia Abu Jamal, Guantanamo prisoners, at least 18 Black Panther Party prisoners, Ricardo Palmera, Sami Al-Arian, Oscar Lopez Rivera, Holy Land 5, Eric McDavid and Marie Mason, Abdelhaleem Ashqar, Dr. Rafil Dhafir, Dr. Aafia Siddiqui. We hope to make more people aware of these cases, why they were framed up, how you can learn more about them and help with their defense. <b><i>Organization: Chicago Committee to Free the Cuban 5— Presenters: Stan Smith—Tracks: </i></b><b><i>Anti-Militarism , Black Power, Environmental Justice, Latin America Solidarity, Mideast Solidarity , Indigenous Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Why is the Working Class Important?</b>\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of folks either work for wages or are supported by family members who do.\_ They are the working class who produce all the goods and services.\_ This interactive workshop will examine\_the special role the working class must play in coalition building and building the broad based movement\_needed if we are to move beyond capitalism. \_<b><i>Organization: Salt of the Earth Labor College – Presenters:\_ Steve Valencia and/or Joe Bernick\_– Tracks: Economic Justice, Labor, socialism.</i></b><b>\_</b><b></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Wild Versus Wall</b>\r\n\r\nU.S. immigration, trade and border policies are reaping havoc on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. More than 650 miles of barriers and walls were built without regard for dozens of laws that protect land, air, water, historic and cultural sites and religious freedom. Instead of addressing issues at the root of human migration, lawmakers continually call for a more-of-the-same approach: more walls, agents, and sweetheart deals for security contractors. Sierra Club fights for better border policies and strives to educate the public about the importance of natural areas along U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. Come learn how you can get involved. <b><i>Organization: Sierra Club – Presenters: Dan Millis, program coordinator, Borderlands Project\_ –Tracks:\_ Environmental Justice, Ecological Solidarity</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b><i>\_</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Women fighting back. The status quo must go.</b>\r\n\r\nThe workshop will include women involved in struggles both local and national to stop the war on women being waged in the United States. Hear about the fight to free Marissa Alexander, an African American woman convicted of aggravated assault for firing a shot into the ceiling to stop her abusive husband, the struggle against the anti-choice ballot measure in Albuquerque, the fight to stop the WIC shutdown, and more.\_ <b><i>Organization: W,O,R,D, Women Organized to Resist and Defend—Presenters: Sydney Hodge, WORD Albuquerque, Yvonne Bonilla, WORD Los Angeles—Tracks: Women’s Rights</i></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Writing for Home, School, and Everyday Life</b>\r\n\r\nThis workshop introduces writing pedagogy developed at Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Sandy, and enacted in public parks as part of occupations of the Free University of NYC, and in Bronx, NY open-access college classrooms in the weeks and months following Hurricane Sandy.
