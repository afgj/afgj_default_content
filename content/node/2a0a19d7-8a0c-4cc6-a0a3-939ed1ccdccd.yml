      value: "<em><strong>By John Perry</strong></em>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Perry UK citizen who lives in Masaya, Nicaragua where he works on housing and migration issues and writes about those\_and other topics covered in the Two Worlds blog. This piece was first published in the </span></i><a href=\"https://twoworlds.me/latin-america/unreported-world-and-the-misreporting-of-nicaragua/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Worlds blog</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> responding to a “news” show in the UK. Unfortunately it applies equally to the disinformation propagated by the corporate and progressive media in the US.</span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the violent protests of a year ago, Managua has largely returned to normal. While never the most attractive capital city in Latin America, it remains one of the safest. There are more police on the streets than there were before last year’s violence, but most people find that reassuring. </span><a href=\"https://myrconsultores.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent opinion poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows that the government maintains close to 60% support and that 85% of Nicaraguans would oppose any return to last year’s protests. Nevertheless, if you buy a newspaper, you’ll find it full of anti-government rhetoric. If you watch TV news, there’s a good chance you’ll find the same. According to the world-wide </span><a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2018/08/in-nicaragua-ortegas-control-over-the-media-slips-.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee to Protect Journalists</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, opposition media are in a stronger position than they were before the crisis.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is far from the picture painted in the UK by the Channel 4 series ‘Unreported World’. In a programme from Nicaragua called </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi3k1lCTyT8&amp;t=650s\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Censored</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its presenter Sahar Zand skulks around Managua by taxi, hiding from mysterious pursuers and from the police. She claims it’s unsafe for her to travel in the same car as local reporters, and she keeps telling her photographer to hide their cameras. Journalists in Nicaragua, she says, risk being deported or killed. She finds police at the roadside ‘unsettling’. Avoiding walking in the streets, she says at one point that ‘Nicaragua may be a nation at war’.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a reason for this odd behaviour. Zand seems not to have come to Nicaragua to listen to different political opinions, she’s evidently here to endorse the image of the country presented by the anti-government media. Of the half dozen major opposition newspapers and TV channels, Zand picks three: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Prensa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (a right-wing newspaper) and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canal 10</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100%Noticias</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, TV news channels. The whole programme is devoted to and steered by these opposition sources; no one speaks up for the government or challenges the picture that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Censored</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> presents.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Prensa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> take her to the Divine Mercy church, scene of a siege during last year’s violence. They show her bullet holes, evidence that the ‘students’ who had sheltered there had come under fire from government forces. What they don’t explain is that the adjoining university, the UNAN, was at that time completely controlled by armed protesters. They had </span><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/424966D17DC84E658640A8DC7CC5EE26\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">burned down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> parts of it and a child development centre was </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNMJQ52uquo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">completely destroyed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The day before the armed gangs retreated to the church, they had launched a fusillade against a passing group of government supporters, injuring and hospitalising ten of them. It was hardly surprising that they were being sought by the police, given the </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-AixyWv3BE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weapons they were using</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (and the violence to which </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HXlEo2F2k\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some of them confessed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> afterwards). Hundreds of weapons were </span><a href=\"https://nuevaya.com.ni/presentan-a-terroristas-y-armamento-utilizado-para-cometer-crimenes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovered by police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when the university was retaken.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unreported World uses a video clip of a student at the UNAN, supposedly sheltering from gunfire last year, appealing to her mother to forgive her for getting involved in the protests. This clip was shared worldwide, but it was quickly shown to be play-acting, as any examination of media stories about it would have revealed. </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb72PP4Td9E&amp;index=34&amp;list=UUi3xmHsIieGf_xKCux4x51g\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, made during the same incident, shows a student ‘saying goodbye’ to his mother while ‘under fire’, yet others stand around casually, apparently indifferent to the bullets.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sahar Zand moves on, to talk about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100%Noticias</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, whose director Miguel Mora is in prison on charges of inciting violence. The charges are treated as ridiculous, yet stem from real events. \_On May 29 last year, Mora made the false claim on air that his TV studio was under attack by government sympathisers. He appealed for opposition activists to respond by attacking the Sandinista station, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nuevo Radio Ya</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They did, setting it on fire, holding over 20 radio staff under siege and then shooting at firefighters and police attempting to control the fire and rescue those inside. Only the bravery of the rescue services prevented severe loss of life. The building was destroyed. Not long afterwards, on June 9, it was the turn of the independent </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radio Nicaragua</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be set on fire: such is the opposition’s respect for the diversity of Nicaragua’s media. These incidents and other attacks on government-supporting media and journalists go unmentioned by Unreported World.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zand’s final port of call is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canal 10</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Channel 10), and its reporter Valeska Rivera. She says she is in constant fear of being killed, and is seen assuring her daughter that she will come home every night. In fact just two reporters have been killed as a result of the protests, both by opposition forces: one was Angel Gahona, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJr2f4pGeow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot by protesters in Bluefields</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the other was Eduardo Spiegler, </span><a href=\"https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/464441-cineasta-guatemalteco-muere-arbol-vida/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">killed in Managua</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when he was filming youths demolishing one of the brightly lit ‘trees of life’ that were attacked as government symbols.</span>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canal 10</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also well-known for its false news stories. In March, Valeska Rivera was reporting from an opposition demonstration when she suddenly threw herself to the ground, taking shelter from a police ‘attack’. The incident was </span><a href=\"http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/5888\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filmed by a bystander</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the clip shows that while Rivera and her colleague are lying prone, others stand nearby or sit on steps in the background, unaware of the ‘gunfire’. She went on to </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/canal10nicaragua/videos/vb.101008949946714/388625045020442/?type=2&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that she had faced not only bullets but contact bombs. Despite this repression, as Zand points out, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canal 10</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> still ‘manages’ to broadcast three news bulletins per day, every day.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an irony in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Censored</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> being part of a series called ‘Unreported World’. Rather than tell a story that is genuinely unreported, Sahar Zand repeats the messages already purveyed by the BBC, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the rest. She could have challenged the distorted coverage of Nicaragua found in most of the international media. As the results of recent polls have shown, she would have been reflecting the opinions most Nicaraguans. It’s a pity that when Sahar Zand was in Managua she didn’t get out more.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on this topic, see the media chapter of the online reader on the Nicaragua crisis, </span><a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes-live-from-nicaragua-uprising-or-coup-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Live from Nicaragua: Uprising or Coup?</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, published in April 2019.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fuller summary of the events at the UNAN, with links to evidence ignored by the programme, is given in pp.33-37 of the report </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dismissing the Truth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is available </span><a href=\"https://afgj.org/nicanotes-dismissing-the-truth-debunks-amnesty-internationals-misleading-reports\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>BRIEFS</b>\r\n\r\n<b>By Nan McCurdy</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Forensic Medicine Institute Says Remains are Bismarck Martinez\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 4, experts at the Forensic Medicine Institute reported that the remains found near the Jinotepe Stadium belonged to Bismarck Martinez, after extensive DNA tests comparing the bones with family members. They have yet to say how he died as the bones are somewhat deteriorated and incomplete. Martinez was kidnapped at a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n opposition</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> roadblock, tortured at the Catholic San Jose School in Jinotepe and disappeared. Martinez was a municipal worker and member of a Catholic Christian base community in Managua. After his disappearance, his grandson, Daniel Jose, began carrying a large picture of him to the twice weekly Sandinista Walks for Peace held between July and November of 2018. People were very moved and followed the family and the news. On the phones of various detainees caught last year the police found the videos of Martinez’ torture. The San Jose school was used </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">torture a number of Sandinistas, as can be seen in videos taken by the torturers.
