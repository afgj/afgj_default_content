The day of actions has also been endorsed by leaders of Colombia’s Permanent Committee on Human Rights, Lazos de Dignidad (Links of Dignity), and the FENSUAGRO agricultural workers union. However, the emphasis for this campaign is on organizing international opinion from outside Colombia. Colombia has mounted efforts to convince foreign visitors that Colombia is safe, and a tourist paradise. From the “Colombia Is Passion’ campaign of the last decade, to the more recent “Magical Realism”, “Land of Sabrosura”, and “Colombia: Feel the Rhythm” campaigns, the government has had significant success, winning a coveted World Tourism Organization Award in 2019 as the top tourist destination in South America. Last year Colombia set records for the number of international tourists, with some 4.4 million foreign visitors. <a href=\"http://alabamavidette.tripod.com/webonmediacontents/A%20Guide%20for%20Responsible%20Travel%20to%20Colombia.pdf\"><strong>We are not boycotting travel to Colombia, we are advocating for responsible travel there.</strong></a> We hope that the Colombian authorities will see that it is not us who are damaging the nation's reputation, but the enemies of the peace.\r\n\r\nAnother concern has to do with security. When our Colombian partners organize days of actions and ask us to support them, we do. But right now our partners are being targeted for the worst kinds of threats, violence, and displacement. Every week we are contacted by human rights defenders and social movement leaders who are thinking about leaving Colombia for theirs and their families' safety. We decided it was inappropriate for us to ask our Colombian comrades to incur yet more risk by publicly demonstrating in support of the People's Travel Advisory. Rather, we are using our privilege, as international tourists, to wage this campaign. The Colombian government is not responsive to the cries of its own citizens, nor to international solidarity activists. By taking action as potential tourists, a population the Colombian government woos daily, by using the privilege this status affords, perhaps they will take notice and see:\_<strong>The world is watching!</strong>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.a-aprp-gc.org/a-call-for-militant-positive-action/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.a-aprp-gc.org/a-call-for-militant-positive-action/\">Read A Call for Militant, Positive Action from the All African People’s Revolutionary Party-GC</a></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.coalitionforpeaceincolombia.org/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.coalitionforpeaceincolombia.org/\">Visit the website of the Coalition for Peace in Colombia</a></h2>\r\n&nbsp;"
