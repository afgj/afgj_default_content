The result of cutting off\_Nicaragua from multilateral\_loans would be a serious blow to the economy and a\_certain flood of economic refugees at the US southern border. Nicaragua has\_signed an\_agreement with OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro for the OAS to\_monitor and accompany the municipal election scheduled for November. The\_OAS\_has already set up an office in Nicaragua to work with election officials to\_insure transparency and to strengthen democratic processes. This\_partnership\_between the OAS and the Nicaraguan government removes any possible rationale to\_pass the NICA Act. Considering the negative\_consequences that the NICA Act\_would have on both the ordinary people of Nicaragua and on the United States in\_terms of greater migration, I\_trust that you will vote against the NICA Act if\_it comes to the floor of the House. I hope to hear back from you that you will\_oppose H.R. 1918.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\_</span>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sincerely,</span>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your Name and address</span>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\_</span></p>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">H.R.1918, The Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act\_(NICA) of 2017 states that “The President shall instruct the United States\_Executive Director at each\_international financial institution to use the\_voice, vote, and influence of the United States to oppose any loan for the\_benefit of the Government of Nicaragua….”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">If the NICA Act becomes law, it will cause a serious blow\_to Nicaragua’s economy, creating a new wave of economic refugees to join those\_already coming north from\_Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Nicaraguan government uses foreign assistance from\_the international financial institutions to support social spending on health\_and education which have\_become an ever larger proportion of the national\_budget. As an example, in the 2016 budget, fifty-seven percent was dedicated to\_social spending with education\_spending rising to US$436 million from US$109\_million in\_2006. Important infrastructure\_projects included the completion of the paved road linking Bluefields in the\_South Caribbean Autonomous Region to the Pacific side of the country, and\_construction of new hospitals in Managua and Bilwi, Puerto Cabezas. \_</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">And, while it is true that the Inter-American Development\_Bank has changed its voting formula so that the United States can no longer veto\_loans on its own, the\_World Bank and International Monetary Fund have never\_approved a loan opposed by the US. We also need to remember that the United\_States still owes Nicaragua\_billions of dollars reparations from the 1986 World\_Court decision for damages from the US funded contra war.</span>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/o/7315/p/dia/action4/common/public/?action_KEY=25371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Please Act Today to Let Your Representative Know that this Issue is Important to You.</span></a></h1>\n&nbsp;"
